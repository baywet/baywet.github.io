&lt;p>At Negotium we’re building multiple SharePoint products (&lt;a href="https://www.oceanik.com/">www.oceanik.com&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.theattributesolution.com/">www.theattributesolution.com&lt;/a> …)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ve recently had a complex issue. Let’s say these two products have a common dependency (newtonsoft.json in our case). Now let’s say both products are installed on a single farm and that for some reason you have to uninstall one of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When SharePoint will retract the wsp, it will retract all dll’s that were included within it. Including the common dependency the other product still needs. That is going to break the other product.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
