You may already have heard about it on social network, I’m a SharePoint Server MVP since April the 1st.
I’m really proud to be a part of this awesome community counting Microsoft technologies best professionals and great communities’ contributors.
This incoming year will be full of events, community activities and projects.
I would like to thank:
Jean-Sébastien DUCHENE: Enterprise Client Management French MVP for his advises and for encouraging me to become an MVP (I thought I was not good enough to make it).</description></item></channel></rss>
