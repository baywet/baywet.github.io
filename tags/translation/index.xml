I’ll give a speech about the multilingualism capabilities of SharePoint “Translating SharePoint from beginning to ending”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll talk about how you can successfully implement an multilingual intranet, team sites or public sites using SharePoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re in the area Saturday October the 24th 2015 don’t hesitate to register to the event. Just as a reminder SPS are free events organized by the community with lot of great sessions. This is a good occasion to expand your network, learn a lot of things and to spend a good day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
