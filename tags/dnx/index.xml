This series would require you to use a few scripts to build and publish the website executing them using powershell tasks in the build definition.
You don’t need to do that anymore because two new extensions are available on the marketplace:
I’ve been able to replace most of my scripts using VSTS DNX Tasks</description></item><item><title>Units tests using xUnit and Visual Studio Team Services for DNX projects</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/units-tests-using-xunit-and-vi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/units-tests-using-xunit-and-vi/</guid><description>Introduction DNX will soon be released and there’ll be a growing number of developers wanting to write unit tests to improve the quality of developments.
Ideally you’d like to run these unit tests in a continuous integration process in order to make sure you didn’t introduce any regression/bug or degraded performances.
In .NET world you have many tools to write unit tests:
MSTest/VSTest
NUnit
xUnit
…

[error]Error: The specified credentials cannot be used with the authentication scheme &amp;lsquo;Basic&amp;rsquo;.
[error]Error: Default credentials cannot be supplied for the Basic authentication scheme.

This comes from the fact the provided script doesn’t support azure websies with multiple deployment slots.</description></item><item><title>Building DNX projects using home installed build agent (TFS, VSTS)</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/building-dnx-projects-using-ho/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/building-dnx-projects-using-ho/</guid><description>With DNX/DNU soon to be RTM there’ll be more and more developers eagers to build and deploy ASP.NET core 1 (formerly ASP.NET MVC 5) projects.
If the procedure is well described when you are using hosted agents (the ones microsoft runs for you on Azure), it’s a little more complex when you want to do it on a local agent.

On your agent’s machine you installed and updated visual studio and all the tools right?</description></item></channel></rss>
