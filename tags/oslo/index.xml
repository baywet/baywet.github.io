&lt;p>I’ll give a speech about “setting up your release pipeline for office 365/SharePoint”. (aka devops)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll see together how you can leverage azure and visual studio team services to implement devops processes and increase quality and save time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re in the area on Oct the 22nd don’t hesitate to register to the event. Just as a reminder SPS are free events organized by the community with lot of great sessions. This is a good occasion to expand your network, learn a lot of things and to spend a good day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Outstanding announcements of the SharePoint Conference 2014 for Office 365</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/outstanding-announcements-of-t/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 02:38:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/outstanding-announcements-of-t/</guid><description>&lt;p>Microsoft has given much information during the SharePoint Conference 2014.
