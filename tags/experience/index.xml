&lt;p>I recently transitioned from &lt;strong>Program Manager on Microsoft Graph&lt;/strong> to &lt;strong>Software Developer in the Microsoft Graph SDKs team&lt;/strong>. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my previous team for welcoming me these last 7 months and allowing me to experiment with the role of Program Manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with you some of my experience and learnings as a Program Manager. Before you dive in, &lt;strong>keep in mind this is my personal experience&lt;/strong>, which may differ a lot from team to team, product to product and depend on other circumstances (being remote, cultural, etc&amp;hellip;). &lt;strong>Do not take this article for a single source of truth&lt;/strong>, there are other experiences that have been shared out there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
