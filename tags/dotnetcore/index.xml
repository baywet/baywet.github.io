&lt;p>Obviously it was really early in this “new framework” lifecycle (we were still on a beta version back then) and the tooling plus processes evolved a lot since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good news is you don’t need anymore a complex and often crashing powershell script. You don’t need anymore special tasks either other than standard command line and azure publishing tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New tasks to build/release dotnetcore project with vsts</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 14:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few months ago I wrote a series of articles on how to set up a release pipeline for dnx/dotnetcore projects with vsts targeting azure web apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This series would require you to use a few scripts to build and publish the website executing them using powershell tasks in the build definition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t need to do that anymore because two new extensions are available on the marketplace:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’ve been able to replace most of my scripts using VSTS DNX Tasks&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
