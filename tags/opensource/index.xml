&lt;p>It has been several months I’ve been “playing” with multiple semantic analysis services. I especially discovered &lt;a href="https://www.alchemyapi.com/">www.alchemyapi.com&lt;/a> in April. One interested thing about them being that IBM recently acquired them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="semantic-analysis">Semantic analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is semantic analysis? It’s analyzing text data (or sometimes pictures too) and trying to understand the meaning of the content in order to extract metadata from it. It’s a little lit if I were to give you a document and ask you to read it and say “what concepts is it about? What entities (persons, cities, places, dates…)? etc.”. The ultimate goal being to extract everything automatically.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
