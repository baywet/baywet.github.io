To do so I used Git Tfs &lt;a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs">https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs&lt;/a> which does the job and is well documented &lt;a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/blob/master/doc/usecases/migrate_tfs_to_git.md">https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/blob/master/doc/usecases/migrate_tfs_to_git.md&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s one step where they instruct you to remove *.vspscc and *.vssscc files and to clean up *.sln and *.*proj files from TFS references.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will prevent Visual Studio from trying to reconnect to TFS every time you open the project/solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatically increment SharePoint feature version number during build with build 2015</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/automatically-increment-sharep/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/automatically-increment-sharep/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few months ago Microsoft released a new automated build system with visual studio online /tfs 2015.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This new mechanism is way more open than previous XAML builds, tasks based and easier to customize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the available tasks allows you to run a powershell script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s  say that for one reason you want to increment automatically the version number of your SharePoint features when building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a quick look at the “.feature” file you’ll notice that the version attribute looks like a serialized object (instead of simply being the version number), this is way more complicated than simply parsing a XML file.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
