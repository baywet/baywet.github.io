They also had inconsistencies with display data between multiple calls.
I quickly suspected a configuration issue for the load balancer dispatching calls between the front-end servers. However, I only had access to the SharePoint farm and I had to provide data so the network team so they could start investigating.
Hence the question: how can we determine which server served the request between multiple calls?</description></item></channel></rss>
