&lt;p&gt;This new mechanism is way more open than previous XAML builds, tasks based and easier to customize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the available tasks allows you to run a powershell script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s  say that for one reason you want to increment automatically the version number of your SharePoint features when building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a quick look at the “.feature” file you’ll notice that the version attribute looks like a serialized object (instead of simply being the version number), this is way more complicated than simply parsing a XML file.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Managing Resources, how to make your SharePoint solutions “globally deployed”</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 03:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="clip_"&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_0FECB56F.jpg" alt="clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_0FECB56F.jpg"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to publish this article months ago, back to the time I found this solution. But I did not mostly because of a lack of free time. Sebastien LEVERT, a top SharePoint developer and a member of Montreal’s SharePoint community, recently published a post about the same subject. Read it (sorry it’s in French), I’ll write my post so it is complementary. &lt;a href="https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/"&gt;https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reminders"&gt;Reminders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly summarize, when you develop SharePoint solutions and you want to support multiple languages (localize it) you need to use .net resources. These resx files are a mechanism coming from asp.net and work as a dictionary (key/value). You have to create one file by supported language. Instead of writing texts in the code (which is a bad practice anyway), you now reference these by defined keys.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
