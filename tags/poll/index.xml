&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced at the SharePoint Conference 2014 infopath&amp;rsquo;s discontinuity. They have not yet announced a successor to this technology since it is still under development on their side. (or maybe not even started to develop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better match SharePoint users’ expectations, Microsoft is conducting a major survey to find out what you want to see in SharePoint around forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ideas / opinions, feel free to submit these.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
