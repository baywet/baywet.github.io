When the SharePoint Framework originally shipped, the tooling included KarmaJSto write unit tests.
KarmaJS received a lot of complaints about performance, capabilities, modern JavaScript support… This especially if you use is in combination with PhantomJS, a headless web browser project that has been abandoned a long time ago now which also shipped with SPFx.
While some peoplehave been arguing for a choice in unit testing framework with SPFx like we (almost) have choice in web frameworks, we saw little movement on that front over the last years.</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Pittsburgh 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-23-05-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2018 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-23-05-00-00/</guid><description>I Have the pleasure to announce I have been selected to speak at SPS Pittsburgh 2018.

Those had a conflicting definition of weakmap which caused issues with packages like lodash.
Long version Microsoft recently release v1.4.0 of the SharePoint Framwork and it’s packages. It contains a lot of improvements and one of those probably went unnoticed by many of us.
@types/es6-collections has been replaced by es2015.collection library (native, comes with the compiler/JS Engines).</description></item><item><title>Speaking at Techorama Belgium 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</guid><description>Techorama is a 2-day event that takes place in Antwerp, Belgium from May 22nd to May 24th.
