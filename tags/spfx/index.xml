&lt;p>You can watch the full call &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/sharepoint-framework-community-call-recording-5th-of-december-2019/">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a reminder this new command allows you to scan a SPFx project and get the external configuration automatically.
Doing this reduces greatly the size of your solutions, improving performances for end users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can watch the command in action below and read the documentation &lt;a href="https://pnp.github.io/office365-cli/cmd/spfx/project/project-externalize/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SharePoint Framework 1.8.0 and unit testing: bad Karma</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-180-and-u/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-180-and-u/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sorry, I had to make the pun…. When the SharePoint Framework originally shipped, the tooling included &lt;a href="https://github.com/karma-runner/karma">KarmaJS&lt;/a>to write unit tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KarmaJS received a lot of complaints about performance, capabilities, modern JavaScript support… This especially if you use is in combination with &lt;a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs">PhantomJS&lt;/a>, a headless web browser project that has been abandoned a long time ago now which also shipped with SPFx.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While some people&lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/736">have been arguing for a choice in unit testing framework with SPFx&lt;/a> like we (almost) have choice in web frameworks, we saw little movement on that front over the last years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Pittsburgh 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-23-05-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2018 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-23-05-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>I Have the pleasure to announce I have been selected to speak at SPS Pittsburgh 2018.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Together we’ll see why it’s important to follow the DevOps processes, methodologies, and philosophy and how to implement it for the SharePoint Framework with Visual Studio Team Services (or TFS).

&lt;p>&lt;em>“Azure Functions is one of the most powerful new solutions provided by Microsoft. Customers are leveraging it, and it has generally been available for a year now quietly delivering value across hundreds of projects. Many of you are probably asking yourself questions like “are functions mature enough?” or “are they production ready?” or even “is the right tooling here yet?” when considering this option for your projects.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Charlotte 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-06-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-06-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>I Have the pleasure to announce I have been selected to speak at SPS Charlotte 2018.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS NYC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll give a speech about “&lt;strong>Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework&lt;/strong>”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together we will see how you can transition from either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New SharePoint Framework PnP Samples available: using the Skype UCWA Web SDK to subscribe to people’s status</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tldr">TL;DR;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I added two new SharePoint framework WebParts PnP sample to demonstrate how to use the Unified Communications Web API JavaScript SDK from Skype for business. This SDK allows you to do things like subscribe to a person status, start instant messaging conversations, calls…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/16.gif" alt="16.gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get a look:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/js-skype-status">plain JS sample&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-skype-status">reactJS + Office UI Fabric React sample&lt;/a>(persona card)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="long-version">Long version&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I recently had the occasion to make my first contribution to PnP (besides creating issues and helping investigate those). In these two new samples I show you how to you how to leverage the Skype UCWA SDK to subscribe and display people skype status.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Full version of lodash now available in the SharePoint Framework</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/full-version-of-lodash-now-ava/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2018 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/full-version-of-lodash-now-ava/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Microsoft replaced @types/es6-collections by the es2015.collection library in version &lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki/Release-Notes-for-SPFx-Package-Version-1.4">1.4.0&lt;/a> of the packages. Those had a conflicting definition of weakmap which caused issues with packages like &lt;a href="https://lodash.com/">lodash&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="long-version">Long version&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Microsoft recently release v1.4.0 of the SharePoint Framwork and it’s packages. It contains a lot of improvements and one of those probably went unnoticed by many of us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>@types/es6-collections has been replaced by es2015.collection library (native, comes with the compiler/JS Engines). That package had a “special” definition of WeakMap (among other things) which was causing numerous packages not to work properly, include one of my favorites: lodash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at Techorama Belgium 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</guid><description>&lt;p>Techorama is a 2-day event that takes place in Antwerp, Belgium from May 22nd to May 24th.&lt;/p>
