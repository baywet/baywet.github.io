<span>1 min.</span></p><p>I was invited to demonstrate the new Office 365 CLI externalize command during on the of recent PnP calls.
You can watch the full call here
As a reminder this new command allows you to scan a SPFx project and get the external configuration automatically. Doing this reduces greatly the size of your solutions, improving performances for end users.
You can watch the command in action below and read the documentation here.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-180-and-u/>SharePoint Framework 1.8.0 and unit testing: bad Karma</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 29, 2019</span>
<span>2 min.</span></p><p>Sorry, I had to make the pun…. When the SharePoint Framework originally shipped, the tooling included KarmaJSto write unit tests.
KarmaJS received a lot of complaints about performance, capabilities, modern JavaScript support… This especially if you use is in combination with PhantomJS, a headless web browser project that has been abandoned a long time ago now which also shipped with SPFx.
While some peoplehave been arguing for a choice in unit testing framework with SPFx like we (almost) have choice in web frameworks, we saw little movement on that front over the last years.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-23-05-00-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Pittsburgh 2018</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Aug 23, 2018</span>

I’ll give a speech about “Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework”.
Together we will see how you can transition from either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/>New SharePoint Framework PnP Samples available: using the Skype UCWA Web SDK to subscribe to people’s status</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jan 8, 2018</span>

Long version Microsoft recently release v1.4.0 of the SharePoint Framwork and it’s packages. It contains a lot of improvements and one of those probably went unnoticed by many of us.
@types/es6-collections has been replaced by es2015.collection library (native, comes with the compiler/JS Engines).</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/>Speaking at Techorama Belgium 2017</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Apr 26, 2017</span>

I’ll give a speech about the SharePoint Framework and devops methodologies “Is it possible to do devops with the SharePoint framework?”.
You had it all right with solutions and add-ins. Your release pipeline was set up. Do new technologies and methodologies mean starting over?
