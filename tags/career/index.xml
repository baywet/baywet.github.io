Good Bye Negotium Since I joined AlphaMosaik more than four years ago (I originally joined only for 18 months huhâ€¦), by the acquisition by Negotium and up to this day my working environment and the company I was part of changed a lot.
This company allowed me to maturate and to learn a lot on cultural, personal and professional aspects.</description></item></channel></rss>
