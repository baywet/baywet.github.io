&lt;p>Microsoft replaced @types/es6-collections by the es2015.collection library in version &lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki/Release-Notes-for-SPFx-Package-Version-1.4">1.4.0&lt;/a> of the packages. Those had a conflicting definition of weakmap which caused issues with packages like &lt;a href="https://lodash.com/">lodash&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="long-version">Long version&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Microsoft recently release v1.4.0 of the SharePoint Framwork and it’s packages. It contains a lot of improvements and one of those probably went unnoticed by many of us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>@types/es6-collections has been replaced by es2015.collection library (native, comes with the compiler/JS Engines). That package had a “special” definition of WeakMap (among other things) which was causing numerous packages not to work properly, include one of my favorites: lodash.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
