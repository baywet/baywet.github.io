&lt;p&gt;Service pack 2 for SharePoint 2010 and Service pack 1 for SharePoint 2013 recently came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-support-of-2012r2-at-last-"&gt;A support of 2012R2 at last !&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both service packs bring support for Windows Server 2012R2&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a recurrent problematic for IT services. How to reduce the number of different versions of an operating system in order to make maintenance cheaper and easier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: &lt;strong&gt;“in place” upgrade of operating system for SharePoint 2013 is not supported by Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt;. You need to reinstall the farm and migrate the content. See section “overview of improvements” in this article &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2817429"&gt;https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2817429&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Repackaging of SharePoint 2010 language packs</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/repackaging-of-sharepoint-2010/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2014 19:57:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/repackaging-of-sharepoint-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010 service pack 2 came out a few months ago from now. It brings lot of new things, I’ll blog about that in further posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these new things is the repackaging of language packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed you may have missed it but it is not required anymore to do a progressive installation in order to support MUI in SharePoint 2010 when setting up a new farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, when one wanted to install language packs (let’s take for example French English and Spanish), one had to:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Managing Resources, how to make your SharePoint solutions “globally deployed”</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 03:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="clip_"&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_0FECB56F.jpg" alt="clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_0FECB56F.jpg"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to publish this article months ago, back to the time I found this solution. But I did not mostly because of a lack of free time. Sebastien LEVERT, a top SharePoint developer and a member of Montreal’s SharePoint community, recently published a post about the same subject. Read it (sorry it’s in French), I’ll write my post so it is complementary. &lt;a href="https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/"&gt;https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reminders"&gt;Reminders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly summarize, when you develop SharePoint solutions and you want to support multiple languages (localize it) you need to use .net resources. These resx files are a mechanism coming from asp.net and work as a dictionary (key/value). You have to create one file by supported language. Instead of writing texts in the code (which is a bad practice anyway), you now reference these by defined keys.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
