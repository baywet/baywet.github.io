&lt;p>If your custom solutions rely on PnP PowerShell during their build and/or deployment processes, you will need PnP PowerShell to be installed on the agent.
Unfortunately the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/agents/hosted">Hosted Agents&lt;/a> do not have PnP PowerShell installed by default.
&lt;em>Note: that documentation only applies to the Hosted and Hosted 2017 agents, the Linux Hosted Agent is not supported at the moment&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Customizing page layouts, master pages and image renditions in SharePoint Online</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/customizing-page-layouts-maste/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/customizing-page-layouts-maste/</guid><description>&lt;p>Microsoft recently made changes around look and feel customizations for SharePoint Online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you create a new site collection and try to edit page layouts, master pages or even image renditions, there’s a high chance you’ll get an access denied error message. That even if you’re site collection administrator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Investigating further and checking your permissions on the master page gallery library, you will notice that every and each user has a “deny” permission for “Add and Customize Pages”. That permission level is not one of the originals we’re used to in SharePoint.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
