&lt;p>With the release of Azure DevOps, there’s some &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/toolchain/implement-ci-cd-with-azure-devops">new SPFX documentation&lt;/a> to set up your CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps.  Have a look and share your thoughts.  Your feedback is always welcome! The Patterns and Practices Initiative also includes a newly reorganized DevOps repository for tools and samples around &lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-build-extensions">SharePoint Framework Build and Deploy Practices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have been working around Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD) and DevOps practices in the SharePoint/Azure/Office 365 ecosystem for several years.  In my experience, whether you’re working alone or as part of a team, adopting proper ALM practices is crucial if you want to produce high quality code.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
