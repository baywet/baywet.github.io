&lt;p&gt;Short post to let you know that Microsoft recently announced a new event: the AzureCon. First edition on Sept the 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This free online event will focus on Microsoft’s cloud technologies (mostly Azure) and will be about news and things to come on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great speakers, awesome content, this is the occasion for you to learn a lot about Azure technologies and their usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conference should happen multiple times a year (approximately 4), main reason being: ”with releases and updates every 3 weeks for each service, we simply couldn’t wait for an annual event to announce everything like we do with Ignite and Build” (Microsoft Azure Product Manager)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaker at Collab365</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-collab365/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-collab365/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-collab365/83.jpg" alt="83.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the fact I’ll be speaking at this event among other great speakers, I also have the great privilege to give 4 sessions (oh yeah!).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Montréal 2015</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2015-05-21-00-50-33/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 00:50:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2015-05-21-00-50-33/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Montréal&lt;/p&gt;
