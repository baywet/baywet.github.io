It has become a regular event for me. This SPS is really dear to me because not only I get to see a lot of Canadian MVPs friends but it also was the first event ever I was presenting in (a broken) English a long time ago.
This year I&amp;rsquo;ll present &amp;ldquo;The Microsoft Graph and SharePoint Framework under steroids with Azure functions&amp;rdquo; or how these three technologies really represent a power trio to build customizations in Office 365.</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Charlotte 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-06-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-06-08-00-00/</guid><description>I Have the pleasure to announce I have been selected to speak at SPS Charlotte 2018.
I’ll give a speech about the graph “How to do Dev-Ops with the SharePoint Framework and why it matters”.
Together we’ll see why it’s important to follow the DevOps processes, methodologies, and philosophy and how to implement it for the SharePoint Framework with Visual Studio Team Services (or TFS). Go from the original idea to production automating as much as possible!</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday New York City 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-06-27-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-06-27-08-00-00/</guid><description>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS NYC.

This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.</description></item><item><title>Speaker at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa!</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-sharepoint-saturday/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2013 03:20:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-sharepoint-saturday/</guid><description>Hi everybody, I’m thrilled to announce that I’ll be speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa.
