&lt;p&gt;Almost a month ago now I was presenting at the &lt;a href="https://www.spsevents.org/city/toronto/toronto2018"&gt;SharePoint Saturday Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, huge thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RIZinsights"&gt;Eric Riz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kkhipple"&gt;Kanwal Khipple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nkhamis"&gt;Noorez Khamiz&lt;/a&gt; for organizing the event! More importantly, they had to find a new venue at the last minute because the original one was forced to closed done for a few days and they pulled it off!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Guest on the Microsoft 365 Dev Podcast: Microsoft Graph Open Extensions and Calendering</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-365-dev/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-365-dev/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had the honor to be a guest on the Microsoft 365 Dev Podcast hosted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jthake"&gt;Jeremy Thake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulschaeflein"&gt;Paul Schaeflein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second time I was invited on a podcast (t&lt;a href="https://baywet.github.io/default/b/vincent/posts/entrevue-avec-le-visual-studio-talk-show---sonarqube"&gt;he first one being in French about devops&lt;/a&gt;), this is a fun exercise where the content is delivered as a discussion between the hosts and the guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this episode we discussed about two main topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Microsoft Graph open extensions (currently starting a project using those at 2toLead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Calendar capabilities in the Microsoft Graph (and I shared a few tricks that might interested you if you plan on using those APIs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Jeremy and Paul for giving me this opportunity and for the good conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
