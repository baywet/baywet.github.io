&lt;p>Almost a month ago now I was presenting at the &lt;a href="https://www.spsevents.org/city/toronto/toronto2018">SharePoint Saturday Toronto&lt;/a>, huge thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RIZinsights">Eric Riz&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kkhipple">Kanwal Khipple&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nkhamis">Noorez Khamiz&lt;/a> for organizing the event! More importantly, they had to find a new venue at the last minute because the original one was forced to closed done for a few days and they pulled it off!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guest on the Microsoft 365 Dev Podcast: Microsoft Graph Open Extensions and Calendering</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-365-dev/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-365-dev/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I had the honor to be a guest on the Microsoft 365 Dev Podcast hosted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jthake">Jeremy Thake&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulschaeflein">Paul Schaeflein&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was the second time I was invited on a podcast (t&lt;a href="https://baywet.github.io/default/b/vincent/posts/entrevue-avec-le-visual-studio-talk-show---sonarqube">he first one being in French about devops&lt;/a>), this is a fun exercise where the content is delivered as a discussion between the hosts and the guests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this episode we discussed about two main topics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Microsoft Graph open extensions (currently starting a project using those at 2toLead)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Calendar capabilities in the Microsoft Graph (and I shared a few tricks that might interested you if you plan on using those APIs)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I’d like to thank Jeremy and Paul for giving me this opportunity and for the good conversations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
