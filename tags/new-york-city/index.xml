I’ll give a speech about “Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework”.
Together we will see how you can transition from either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
