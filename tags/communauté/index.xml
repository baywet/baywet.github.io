On Nov the 23rd!
My session: translating SharePoint 2013 from beginning to ending. We’ll cover all multilingualism provided by SharePoint.
With lot of examples and demonstrations we’ll see what are the tools provided to IT pro’s, power users and developers. The goal of this session is to give you some insight about how to get your SharePoint environment in multiple languages seamlessly.</description></item></channel></rss>
