&lt;p>Back in January, I celebrated 5 years at Microsoft! It’s incredible how fast time can fly. I initially started working as a program manager II on Microsoft Graph Change Notifications (aka webhooks) and Change Tracking (aka delta queries). A transfer and a few promotions later I’m now a Principal Software Developer, working on Microsoft Graph client experiences (SDKs, kiota, copilot extensibility, OpenAPI…)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I recently transitioned from &lt;strong>Program Manager on Microsoft Graph&lt;/strong> to &lt;strong>Software Developer in the Microsoft Graph SDKs team&lt;/strong>. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my previous team for welcoming me these last 7 months and allowing me to experiment with the role of Program Manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with you some of my experience and learnings as a Program Manager. Before you dive in, &lt;strong>keep in mind this is my personal experience&lt;/strong>, which may differ a lot from team to team, product to product and depend on other circumstances (being remote, cultural, etc&amp;hellip;). &lt;strong>Do not take this article for a single source of truth&lt;/strong>, there are other experiences that have been shared out there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Joining Microsoft as a Program Manager on the Microsoft Graph</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/joining-microsoft-as-a-program/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 11:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/joining-microsoft-as-a-program/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’ll be starting at Microsoft as a Program Manager on the Microsoft Graph in January. This is an exiting change and I’d like to take the time to thank 2toLead for the amazing last few years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-role">New role&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’m exited to announce I’ll be starting at Microsoft in January as a Program Manager on the Microsoft Graph (and other Microsoft Identity Platform topics). I’ll be part of the MIP organization and in the extended team of brilliant people like Yina Arenas, Jeremy Thake, Darrel Miller and many more.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
