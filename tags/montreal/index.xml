&lt;p>This year again I have the privilege to be part of the organizing committee for SharePoint Saturday Montréal 2018 taking place June the 2nd at Cégep du vieux Montréal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s free, it’s the occasion to learn a lot, not only about SharePoint but also about Office 365 and Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year in a few numbers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>25 sessions (in English and French)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 Keynote by the Great Serge Tremblay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>16 Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 MSP (Microsoft Student Partner)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 MCT (Microsoft Certified Trainers)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>9 partners&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200 attendees (planned)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Besides the content, it’s also the occasion to develop your network, eat some Schwartz (smoked meat) and “SharePint” (Share a pint) !&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Montréal 2016</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-03-30-15-36-54/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 15:36:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-03-30-15-36-54/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Montréal&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also had the occasion to help organize the event this year, it’s been an interesting experience so far and I’d like to thank Serge, Nico, Luc, Seb and Fabrice for their implication in that project, it’s much more work than what we think!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time I’ll talk about setting up your release pipeline for SharePoint/Office 365 developments in Visual Studio Online (Team Foundation Services).
