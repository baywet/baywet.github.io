&lt;p>We recently &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/tailored-sdk-experiences-via-kiota-now-generally-available/">announced the general availability of Kiota&lt;/a>, an open source client generator for REST APIs with an OpenAPI description. I am the co-founder of this product, and this launch matches my 3 years anniversary at Microsoft, so I thought I would take the time to write about my experience of taking a product from idea to v1 at Microsoft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout my career, I have been involved with multiple “products”: a second-hand marketplace for industrial hardware, an enterprise social network solution, a localization and translation solution for SharePoint, and an IoT based temperature management optimization solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One year as a Software Developer at Microsoft</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/one-year-developer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/one-year-developer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="one-year-as-a-software-developer-at-microsoft">One year as a Software Developer at Microsoft&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Back in September 2020, I published a &lt;a href="https://baywet.github.io/pm-experience-dev-sdk/">blog post about my experience as a Program Manager at Microsoft that was well received&lt;/a>. It made me realize that the community was curious and interested about this role. In this post, I will share my insights as a developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we begin, &lt;strong>keep in mind this is my personal experience&lt;/strong>, which may differ a lot from team to team, product to product and depend on other circumstances (being remote, culture, etc…).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revamping the Microsoft Graph Java SDK: a recipe to revive open-source repositories</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/github-repo-revival/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/github-repo-revival/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back in August 2020 I became the main maintainer of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-java">Microsoft Graph Java SDK&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team had to deprioritize this SDK in favor of other languages due to a lack of staff. About 100+ issues were open, as well as 15 pull requests from the community. Dependencies and tooling had not been updated, the Android story was unclear, no innovation had been done in a long time, the repository felt abandoned and caused a lot of frustrations…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitHub Actions: Automatic conflicting pull request tagging and comment</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/pull-request-conflict-github-workflow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/pull-request-conflict-github-workflow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open-source repositories enable tremendous productivity in software development. Growth in user base usually translates in growth in contributors, which in turns translates in a better solution bringing more users and so on&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Maintaining large open-source repositories can be time-consuming&lt;/strong> as you spend more and more time reviewing contributions. Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, that time spent reviewing pull requests is mostly well spent as it represents a factor of scale efficiency gain: for minutes spent reviewing any given pull request, the codebase benefits hours of development efforts invested by the contributor.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>.Net Library for Alchemy API</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/net-library-for-alchemy-api/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/net-library-for-alchemy-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/net-library-for-alchemy-api/82.png" alt="82.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been several months I’ve been “playing” with multiple semantic analysis services. I especially discovered &lt;a href="https://www.alchemyapi.com/">www.alchemyapi.com&lt;/a> in April. One interested thing about them being that IBM recently acquired them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="semantic-analysis">Semantic analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is semantic analysis? It’s analyzing text data (or sometimes pictures too) and trying to understand the meaning of the content in order to extract metadata from it. It’s a little lit if I were to give you a document and ask you to read it and say “what concepts is it about? What entities (persons, cities, places, dates…)? etc.”. The ultimate goal being to extract everything automatically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Availability of office 365 Samples and SDK on Github</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/availability-of-office-365-sam/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2014 16:53:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/availability-of-office-365-sam/</guid><description>&lt;p>For those who have not seen it yet Microsoft teams who work on Office 365 have created a hub on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/officedev">https://github.com/officedev&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are you going to find there?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Examples of code made by Microsoft and the community&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Demonstrations presented during the sessions from Microsoft and the community&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Part of the &amp;lsquo;documents&amp;rsquo; sources for the MSDN documentation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SDK for &amp;rsquo;third&amp;rsquo; platforms (IOS, android&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>…&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The message behind that is Microsoft is investing in the community and wants to create a single place where developers (from any platform) can meet to participate in the projects together and share content. Therefore do not hesitate to have a look and to submit content / patches / projects.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
