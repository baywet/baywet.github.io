&lt;p>This series would require you to use a few scripts to build and publish the website executing them using powershell tasks in the build definition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t need to do that anymore because two new extensions are available on the marketplace:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’ve been able to replace most of my scripts using VSTS DNX Tasks&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Houston 2016</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-04-01-14-00-00/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-04-01-14-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year I have the privilege to speak at SPS Houston (first time!!).

&lt;p>I also had the occasion to help organize the event this year, it’s been an interesting experience so far and I’d like to thank Serge, Nico, Luc, Seb and Fabrice for their implication in that project, it’s much more work than what we think!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time I’ll talk about setting up your release pipeline for SharePoint/Office 365 developments in Visual Studio Online (Team Foundation Services).

&lt;p>Entity Framework is a well-known technology in the ORM domain for the .NET world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Object Relational Mapping, this is the part between data persistence unit and some more “high level” code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you start a new entity framework project you have a few different ways to do it, one of which being “code first”. It means our code will drive the SQL Schema evolution (which simplifies a lot of things and allows you to focus on business and not technical implementation).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
