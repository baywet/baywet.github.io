I’ll give a speech about “Make Graph data useful for your company”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll see how we can leverage the new Microsoft Graph API and Machine Learning tools to build “clever” applications for our business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re in the area Saturday April the 23rd 2016 don’t hesitate to register to the event. Just as a reminder SPS are free events organized by the community with lot of great sessions. This is a good occasion to expand your network, learn a lot of things and to spend a good day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
