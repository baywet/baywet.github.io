&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently made a new build definitions model with the release of Visual Studio 2015 (TFS 2015’s bits are not yet available but this new build service is already available on Visual Studio Online).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a reminder the “old” build models were based on two artifacts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The build process template: defined via XAML, it allows you to configure the sequence for the build process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The build definition: links together the template, sources and some settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This methodology offers a wide range of possibilities to automate your build, packaging, testing and even deployment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Repackaging of SharePoint 2010 language packs</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/repackaging-of-sharepoint-2010/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2014 19:57:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/repackaging-of-sharepoint-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010 service pack 2 came out a few months ago from now. It brings lot of new things, I’ll blog about that in further posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these new things is the repackaging of language packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed you may have missed it but it is not required anymore to do a progressive installation in order to support MUI in SharePoint 2010 when setting up a new farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, when one wanted to install language packs (let’s take for example French English and Spanish), one had to:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Managing Resources, how to make your SharePoint solutions “globally deployed”</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 03:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="clip_"&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_0FECB56F.jpg" alt="clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_0FECB56F.jpg"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to publish this article months ago, back to the time I found this solution. But I did not mostly because of a lack of free time. Sebastien LEVERT, a top SharePoint developer and a member of Montreal’s SharePoint community, recently published a post about the same subject. Read it (sorry it’s in French), I’ll write my post so it is complementary. &lt;a href="https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/"&gt;https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reminders"&gt;Reminders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly summarize, when you develop SharePoint solutions and you want to support multiple languages (localize it) you need to use .net resources. These resx files are a mechanism coming from asp.net and work as a dictionary (key/value). You have to create one file by supported language. Instead of writing texts in the code (which is a bad practice anyway), you now reference these by defined keys.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
