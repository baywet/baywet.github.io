My French blog has been running for more than six years now (gee, I’m getting old).
From 2013 to 2014, before I decided to open an English dedicated blog, I was posting every blog entry in English and in French.
Over time it got messy for both communities so I decided to open this blog. But I couldn’t move the old content to this new blog without having to spend hours doing so.</description></item><item><title>The former MSP becomes MVP</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/the-former-msp-becomes-mvp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 01:37:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/the-former-msp-becomes-mvp/</guid><description>SharePoint MVP
