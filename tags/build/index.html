I hope that this series has helped you to go faster implementing it.
Now, you can clearly identify your technical debt and take actions to improve the quality of your developments.
It is obvious that when a thousand problems appear in the code at once, it can be discouraging, just keep this in mind:

Configuration of the authentication module
Since version 5.4 SonarQube provides an additional plugin relying on the OAuth protocol to communicate with AAD. This will allow the users to leverage their corporate account to access SonarQube, providing SSO and simplifying the administrators job by having a central identity repository.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/>New tasks to build/release dotnetcore project with vsts</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Aug 10, 2016</span>

Ideally you’d like to run these unit tests in a continuous integration process in order to make sure you didn’t introduce any regression/bug or degraded performances.
In .NET world you have many tools to write unit tests:

NUnit

If you followed my posts you must have noticed you dll’s were built but you didn’t have any wsp.
This is because by default msbuild doesn’t package your solutions. That’s pity isn’t it?
