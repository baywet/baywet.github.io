Growth in user base usually translates in growth in contributors, which in turns translates in a better solution bringing more users and so on&amp;hellip; Maintaining large open-source repositories can be time-consuming as you spend more and more time reviewing contributions. Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, that time spent reviewing pull requests is mostly well spent as it represents a factor of scale efficiency gain: for minutes spent reviewing any given pull request, the codebase benefits hours of development efforts invested by the contributor.</description></item><item><title>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Conclusion</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-06-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-06-08-00-00/</guid><description>Installing and setting up SonarQube may seem quite complex and tedious.
I hope that this series has helped you to go faster implementing it.
Now, you can clearly identify your technical debt and take actions to improve the quality of your developments.
It is obvious that when a thousand problems appear in the code at once, it can be discouraging, just keep this in mind:

This will allow our developers to use the same account between Visual Studio Team Services and SonarQube.
Configuration of the authentication module
Since version 5.4 SonarQube provides an additional plugin relying on the OAuth protocol to communicate with AAD. This will allow the users to leverage their corporate account to access SonarQube, providing SSO and simplifying the administrators job by having a central identity repository.</description></item><item><title>New tasks to build/release dotnetcore project with vsts</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 14:02:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/</guid><description>A few months ago I wrote a series of articles on how to set up a release pipeline for dnx/dotnetcore projects with vsts targeting azure web apps.

Note: Object Relational Mapping, this is the part between data persistence unit and some more “high level” code.
When you start a new entity framework project you have a few different ways to do it, one of which being “code first”. It means our code will drive the SQL Schema evolution (which simplifies a lot of things and allows you to focus on business and not technical implementation).</description></item><item><title>Units tests using xUnit and Visual Studio Team Services for DNX projects</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/units-tests-using-xunit-and-vi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/units-tests-using-xunit-and-vi/</guid><description>Introduction DNX will soon be released and there’ll be a growing number of developers wanting to write unit tests to improve the quality of developments.

In .NET world you have many tools to write unit tests:

NUnit

This is because by default msbuild doesn’t package your solutions. That’s pity isn’t it?
