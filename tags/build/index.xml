Growth in user base usually translates in growth in contributors, which in turns translates in a better solution bringing more users and so on&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Maintaining large open-source repositories can be time-consuming&lt;/strong> as you spend more and more time reviewing contributions. Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, that time spent reviewing pull requests is mostly well spent as it represents a factor of scale efficiency gain: for minutes spent reviewing any given pull request, the codebase benefits hours of development efforts invested by the contributor.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Conclusion</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-06-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-06-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>Installing and setting up SonarQube may seem quite complex and tedious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope that this series has helped you to go faster implementing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, you can clearly identify your technical debt and take actions to improve the quality of your developments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is obvious that when a thousand problems appear in the code at once, it can be discouraging, just keep this in mind:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;p>There are false positives, make a first pass to ignore/exclude those&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Monitoring the results</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-02-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-02-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Static analysis errors will appear as of the warnings in the compilation section. A static analysis badge will also appear on the build report and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to have detailed and comprehensive information from SonarQube.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="information-incorporated-with-the-build">Information incorporated with the build&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When displaying the details of a build, you&amp;rsquo;ll now find a new section dedicated to SonarQube. Within that section, besides the quality badge, you&amp;rsquo;ll also find a link to the static analysis results details. Also under the build section, all static analysis critical issues will show up as warnings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Setting up Azure Active directory for authentication</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-25-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-25-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will install and configure an add-on to delegate authentication to Azure Active Directory. This will allow our developers to use the same account between Visual Studio Team Services and SonarQube.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Configuration of the authentication module&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since version 5.4 SonarQube provides an additional plugin relying on the OAuth protocol to communicate with AAD. This will allow the users to leverage their corporate account to access SonarQube, providing SSO and simplifying the administrators job by having a central identity repository.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New tasks to build/release dotnetcore project with vsts</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 14:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few months ago I wrote a series of articles on how to set up a release pipeline for dnx/dotnetcore projects with vsts targeting azure web apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This series would require you to use a few scripts to build and publish the website executing them using powershell tasks in the build definition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t need to do that anymore because two new extensions are available on the marketplace:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Entity Framework is a well-known technology in the ORM domain for the .NET world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Object Relational Mapping, this is the part between data persistence unit and some more “high level” code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you start a new entity framework project you have a few different ways to do it, one of which being “code first”. It means our code will drive the SQL Schema evolution (which simplifies a lot of things and allows you to focus on business and not technical implementation).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Units tests using xUnit and Visual Studio Team Services for DNX projects</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/units-tests-using-xunit-and-vi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/units-tests-using-xunit-and-vi/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>DNX will soon be released and there’ll be a growing number of developers wanting to write unit tests to improve the quality of developments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ideally you’d like to run these unit tests in a continuous integration process in order to make sure you didn’t introduce any regression/bug or degraded performances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In .NET world you have many tools to write unit tests:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>MSTest/VSTest&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>NUnit&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>xUnit&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>…&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>In our case we chose to use xUnit because it is widely used and supported by the community, and it’s one of the few to support DNX at the moment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building DNX projects using home installed build agent (TFS, VSTS)</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/building-dnx-projects-using-ho/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/building-dnx-projects-using-ho/</guid><description>&lt;p>With DNX/DNU soon to be RTM there’ll be more and more developers eagers to build and deploy ASP.NET core 1 (formerly ASP.NET MVC 5) projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the procedure is well described when you are using hosted agents (the ones microsoft runs for you on Azure), it’s a little more complex when you want to do it on a local agent.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This new mechanism is way more open than previous XAML builds, tasks based and easier to customize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the available tasks allows you to run a powershell script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s  say that for one reason you want to increment automatically the version number of your SharePoint features when building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a quick look at the “.feature” file you’ll notice that the version attribute looks like a serialized object (instead of simply being the version number), this is way more complicated than simply parsing a XML file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying cloud service via new 2015 build templates</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/deploying-cloud-service-via-ne/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/deploying-cloud-service-via-ne/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction-to-the-new-build-system">Introduction to the new build system&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Microsoft recently made a new build definitions model with the release of Visual Studio 2015 (TFS 2015’s bits are not yet available but this new build service is already available on Visual Studio Online).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as a reminder the “old” build models were based on two artifacts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The build process template: defined via XAML, it allows you to configure the sequence for the build process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The build definition: links together the template, sources and some settings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This methodology offers a wide range of possibilities to automate your build, packaging, testing and even deployment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automated build for SharePoint 2013 full trust solutions – Where are my solutions?</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/automated-build-for-sharepoint-2014-12-04-01-12-13/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2014 01:12:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/automated-build-for-sharepoint-2014-12-04-01-12-13/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another episode of my series about automated build of SharePoint full trust solutions with tfs 2013 and visual studio 2013.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It has been a few articles I’ve been mentioning the fact that we (Negotium, the company I work for) have migrated to visual studio online (TFS Online). &lt;strong>This service offers most of the features offered by the on premises version of Team Foundation Server 2013 and even some exclusive features&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have only a vague idea of what can do TFS2013/VSO and you want to learn more I very highly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Professional-Application-Lifecycle-Management-Visual/dp/1118836588/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1412643305&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=professional&amp;#43;application&amp;#43;lifecycle">Professional Application Lifecycle Management&lt;/a> from Wrox.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Converting a protected by password certificate (pfx) to an unprotected one (snk)</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/converting-a-protected-by-pass/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2014 01:06:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/converting-a-protected-by-pass/</guid><description>&lt;p>At work I am trying to implement &lt;strong>automated build for SharePoint&lt;/strong> (full trust) projects on visual studio online. (Expect to have several articles about this as and when I meet and solve errors)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When doing SharePoint development &lt;strong>we have to sign assemblies with a certificate&lt;/strong>. When the project is initialized there are two options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Certificate is protected by a password: (pfx extension) that was with first versions of SharePoint tooling, or if you have created the structure of (visual studio) solution yourself with several assemblies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Certificate is not protected: (snk extension) default option of the tooling for a few years&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In my case the certificate was protected by a password&lt;/strong> which causes the following problem: that you have to type this password when you want to build the source on a new machine for the first time. This is really not convenient when doing automated build (no human to type a password when building). &lt;strong>This gives us this error message.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
