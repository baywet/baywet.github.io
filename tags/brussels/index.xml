I’ll give a speech about “setting up your release pipeline for office 365/SharePoint”. (aka devops)
We’ll see together how you can leverage azure and visual studio team services to implement devops processes and increase quality and save time.
If you’re in the area on Oct the 15th don’t hesitate to register to the event. Just as a reminder SPS are free events organized by the community with lot of great sessions.</description></item></channel></rss>
