This event is dear to my heart as it’s one of the first international events I ever got to speak at, it always attracts a great crowd and brings together internationally regarded speakers.
I’ll be presenting “Turbocharge your API integration with Microsoft Kiota” where I’ll be introducing through lots of demonstrations how you can generate a client generated for any OpenAPI described API using Microsoft Kiota and other tools.</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Brussels 2016</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-09-22-14-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-09-22-14-00-00/</guid><description>This year I have the privilege to speak at SPS Brussels
I’ll give a speech about “setting up your release pipeline for office 365/SharePoint”. (aka devops)
We’ll see together how you can leverage azure and visual studio team services to implement devops processes and increase quality and save time.
If you’re in the area on Oct the 15th don’t hesitate to register to the event. Just as a reminder SPS are free events organized by the community with lot of great sessions.</description></item></channel></rss>
