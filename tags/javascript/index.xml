&lt;p>Internet Explorer has been a corporate browser for two decades now. And many of us remember the dark ages of web development when we needed to have “IE compatible code” and “web compatible code”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As many companies invested deeply in the browser building portals that worked with specific versions, Microsoft provided a decade ago a compatibility mode, allowing the browser to “behave” like a former version of itself and stay compatible with websites that had not been updated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Determine whether or not a SharePoint library is running with the new experience</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/determine-whether-or-not-a-sha/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/determine-whether-or-not-a-sha/</guid><description>&lt;p>Microsoft just released the new experience for SharePoint libraries and I know a lot of you built custom look and feel and/or components on top of the library ui. (I’m thinking in particular about ScriptLink actions)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be in a situation where the code you need to run will be different depending on the experience being used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a little bit of research, here is an example of solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SharePoint apps (add-ins) JavaScript disappeared</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-apps-add-ins-javasc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 04:09:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-apps-add-ins-javasc/</guid><description>&lt;p>At Negotium we recently came across a weird problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s assume you previously built a Provider hosted app for SharePoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let’s assume you updated to the latest version of the SDK (April/May update)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally let’s assume your tenant has been updated recently (v16.0.4121.1212 or above)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s likely that you are loading SP.*.js files and MicrosoftAjax.js the way it used to be recommended by Microsoft per say: &amp;lt;HostWebUrl&amp;gt;/_layouts/15/jsfile.js or &amp;lt;AppWebUrl&amp;gt;/_layouts/15/jsfile.js.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maximum provided results to generate refiners</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/maximum-provided-results-to-ge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2015 15:41:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/maximum-provided-results-to-ge/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since SharePoint 2010 you have the ability to improve the search experience in adding custom search refiners. Even better you can develop new ones if you want. As a reminder search refiners (or facets) are located on the left of the search result page and allow you to filter search results to have a faster access to relevant items. (file type, author, modification date…)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.ithinksharepoint.com/2013/09/27/building-a-sharepoint-2013-search-refiner-with-custom-intervals/">Here is some documentation if you’d like to know more about it.&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Localizing JavaScript of a Full Trust solution</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/localizing-javascript-of-a-ful/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2014 03:58:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/localizing-javascript-of-a-ful/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We, SharePoint developers of ancient times when &amp;ldquo;full trust&amp;rdquo; solutions ruled, have understood one thing: using JavaScript improves by far our solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed this allows to reduce the load of the servers and makes the user experience more &amp;ldquo;responsive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what if you want to display messages in different languages depending on the user? In .NET (understand server-side) it is quite simple, just use of resources. (&lt;a href="../the-name-initializecon">see one of my posts on the subject&lt;/a>)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
