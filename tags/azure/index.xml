Preamble There is bad quality code in every development project. This goes from the quick and dirty hack we are not proud of, to the long-forgotten code written by a developer who quit the company.
The problem with this code is that it will eventually accumulate and slow down the pace of new features delivery.</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Calgary 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-03-07-16-00-00/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-03-07-16-00-00/</guid><description>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Calgary.

Short post to let you know that Microsoft recently announced a new event: the AzureCon. First edition on Sept the 29th.
This free online event will focus on Microsoft’s cloud technologies (mostly Azure) and will be about news and things to come on the platform.
Great speakers, awesome content, this is the occasion for you to learn a lot about Azure technologies and their usage.
This conference should happen multiple times a year (approximately 4), main reason being: ”with releases and updates every 3 weeks for each service, we simply couldn’t wait for an annual event to announce everything like we do with Ignite and Build” (Microsoft Azure Product Manager)</description></item><item><title>Speaker at Collab365</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-collab365/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-collab365/</guid><description>I’ve been greatly honored being selected to be speaker at collab 365.

For those who didn’t know it already, you can set the “appSettings” settings of your web application from the azure portal.
This technique has several advantages over the traditional xsl transformation:
Only the admin knows the settings, they are not on the source control Rich UI experience Settings can be “slot relative” (checkbox on the right), this allows you to have something like “this setting has this value in staging and that value in production which have to remain with each slot, even if I swap the deployments” I recnetly found a bug with that tool.</description></item><item><title>Maintaining your tech skills and free cinema</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/maintaining-your-tech-skills-a/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/maintaining-your-tech-skills-a/</guid><description>One of the best part of my job which is also the most difficult one is always having to learn new stuff.
It’s great to have the opportunity to learn new things every day, it keeps my job interesting and challenging through the years.
