&lt;p>Back in January, I celebrated 5 years at Microsoft! It’s incredible how fast time can fly. I initially started working as a program manager II on Microsoft Graph Change Notifications (aka webhooks) and Change Tracking (aka delta queries). A transfer and a few promotions later I’m now a Principal Software Developer, working on Microsoft Graph client experiences (SDKs, kiota, copilot extensibility, OpenAPI…)&lt;/p>

This series of events is organized by Microsoft and presenters are picked among Microsoft Employees, Regional Directors and MVPs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll have the opportunity to present one session “&lt;strong>How to do DevOps with the SharePoint Framework and why it matters?&lt;/strong>”. During this session we will explore together how you can setup your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline leveraging Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Toronto 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-11-20-09-00-00/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-11-20-09-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Toronto.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll give a speech about “&lt;strong>Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework&lt;/strong>”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together we will see how you can transition from &lt;strong>either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach&lt;/strong>. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Fest Seattle 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-se/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-se/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>SharePoint Fest Seattle 2018 is happening from August 20th to 24th&lt;/strong>.

Customers are leveraging it, and it has generally been available for a year now quietly delivering value across hundreds of projects.

&lt;p>This year again I have the privilege to be part of the organizing committee for SharePoint Saturday Montréal 2018 taking place June the 2nd at Cégep du vieux Montréal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s free, it’s the occasion to learn a lot, not only about SharePoint but also about Office 365 and Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year in a few numbers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>25 sessions (in English and French)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 Keynote by the Great Serge Tremblay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>16 Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 MSP (Microsoft Student Partner)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 MCT (Microsoft Certified Trainers)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>9 partners&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll provision a ubuntu server in Azure, and install Putty and WinSCP on your local machine&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="details-of-provisioning">Details of provisioning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here is a link to a documentation explaining how to do it&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is! the machine is being provisioned!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile take the opportunity to download a SSH terminal if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.PuTTY.org/">https://www.PuTTY.org/&lt;/a>  (you can also install WinSCP that will also provide a GUI to transfer files)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - What parts to use?</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-11-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-11-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Because we use a maximum of services cloud at 2toLead I realized the following installation:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Build system: build 2015 VSTS&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build machine: provided by VSTS as a service&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SonarQube machine: Ubuntu Server hosted in Azure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data SonarQube: Azure SQL Database, 10 DTU&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Note that to facilitate the management of the SonarQube &amp;ldquo;box&amp;quot; we are going to install Docker on the ubuntu machine. Once docker installed, we&amp;rsquo;ll hydrate two containers, nginx and SonarQube.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Static analysis</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-08-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-08-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="introduction-to-static-analysis">Introduction to static analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The principle of static analysis is to take advantage of rules set more or less complex, those will detect patterns in the code that are problematic, categorize their importance and suggest a resolution.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This series will explain *how to set up an automated code quality analysis* which is almost free of charge with Visual Studio Team Services, Docker, Azure, and SonarQube.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preamble">Preamble&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is bad quality code in every development project. This goes from the quick and dirty hack we are not proud of, to the long-forgotten code written by a developer who quit the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with this code is that it will eventually accumulate and slow down the pace of new features delivery. The reasons are various, a lot of time spent in bug fixes, refactoring, support&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Calgary 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-03-07-16-00-00/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-03-07-16-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Calgary.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Short post to let you know that Microsoft recently announced a new event: the AzureCon. First edition on Sept the 29th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This free online event will focus on Microsoft’s cloud technologies (mostly Azure) and will be about news and things to come on the platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great speakers, awesome content, this is the occasion for you to learn a lot about Azure technologies and their usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This conference should happen multiple times a year (approximately 4), main reason being: ”with releases and updates every 3 weeks for each service, we simply couldn’t wait for an annual event to announce everything like we do with Ignite and Build” (Microsoft Azure Product Manager)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaker at Collab365</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-collab365/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-collab365/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-collab365/83.jpg" alt="83.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been greatly honored being selected to be speaker at collab 365.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event directly comes from the sp24 with the spbiz which happened a few months from now. It’s a free online event which will take place on October the 8th during 24 hours all around the globe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Microsoft recently made a new build definitions model with the release of Visual Studio 2015 (TFS 2015’s bits are not yet available but this new build service is already available on Visual Studio Online).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as a reminder the “old” build models were based on two artifacts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The build process template: defined via XAML, it allows you to configure the sequence for the build process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The build definition: links together the template, sources and some settings.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>For those who didn’t know it already, you can set the “appSettings” settings of your web application from the azure portal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This technique has several advantages over the traditional xsl transformation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Only the admin knows the settings, they are not on the source control&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rich UI experience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Settings can be “slot relative” (checkbox on the right), this allows you to have something like “this setting has this value in staging and that value in production which have to remain with each slot, even if I swap the deployments”&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I recnetly found a bug with that tool. Let’s say we define only appSettings keys in the web.config file because values are going to be set by the configuration service anyway.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maintaining your tech skills and free cinema</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/maintaining-your-tech-skills-a/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/maintaining-your-tech-skills-a/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the best part of my job which is also the most difficult one is always having to learn new stuff.&lt;/p>
