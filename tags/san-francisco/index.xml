During “&lt;a href="https://sched.co/1AgrE">Lessons learned from client generation, gaps and suggestions to address them&lt;/a>”, we’ll be reviewing my 2 years experience building an &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/kiota">OpenAPI based client generator&lt;/a> and trying to identify solutions to ease up code generation, leading to better clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The API specification conference is the first in person event I’ll be presenting at in almost 3 years, I’m really excited and a bit nervous (do I even remember how to do this anymore?). This conference focuses on the standards (HTTP, OpenAPI, JSON Schema&amp;hellip;) and practices revolving around building APIs, it is organized in partnership with the Linux Foundation and the lineup is impressive!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
