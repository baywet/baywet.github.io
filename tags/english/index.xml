During the SharePoint Conference 2014 Microsoft announced a significant change in the limitations of SharePoint Online Storage: 1 TB Max per site collection (including the &amp;ldquo;mysite&amp;rdquo; or onedrive for business) and unlimited storage (understanding billed per GB) by tenant.</description></item><item><title>Anonymous access for SharePoint autohosted apps</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/anonymous-access-for-sharepoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2014 17:03:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/anonymous-access-for-sharepoin/</guid><description>These days I’ve been working on an auto hosted app for SharePoint (office 365 actually).
I had to grant an anonymous access to one of the pages without requiring clients to give anonymous access to their SharePoint site. But I still needed to read a few properties from the App Web web site (the SPWeb provisioned by SharePoint when installing an app)
I had to play around a lot but I finally found the solution:</description></item><item><title>Operating system compatibility of SharePoint 2010/2013 has evolved</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/operating-system-compatibility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 02:40:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/operating-system-compatibility/</guid><description>Service pack 2 for SharePoint 2010 and Service pack 1 for SharePoint 2013 recently came out.

It brings lot of new things, I’ll blog about that in further posts.
One of these new things is the repackaging of language packs.
Indeed you may have missed it but it is not required anymore to do a progressive installation in order to support MUI in SharePoint 2010 when setting up a new farm.
