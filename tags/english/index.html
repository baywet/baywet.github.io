<span>1 min.</span></p><p>Everything is in the title. My French blog has been running for more than six years now (gee, I’m getting old).
From 2013 to 2014, before I decided to open an English dedicated blog, I was posting every blog entry in English and in French.
Over time it got messy for both communities so I decided to open this blog. But I couldn’t move the old content to this new blog without having to spend hours doing so.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/outstanding-announcements-of-t/>Outstanding announcements of the SharePoint Conference 2014 for Office 365</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 25, 2014</span>
<span>4 min.</span></p><p>Microsoft has given much information during the SharePoint Conference 2014. It is sometimes difficult to not miss something, so I made a summary of information that marked me.
Storage evolution 1 TB and beyond! During the SharePoint Conference 2014 Microsoft announced a significant change in the limitations of SharePoint Online Storage: 1 TB Max per site collection (including the &ldquo;mysite&rdquo; or onedrive for business) and unlimited storage (understanding billed per GB) by tenant.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/anonymous-access-for-sharepoin/>Anonymous access for SharePoint autohosted apps</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 12, 2014</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>These days I’ve been working on an auto hosted app for SharePoint (office 365 actually).
I had to grant an anonymous access to one of the pages without requiring clients to give anonymous access to their SharePoint site. But I still needed to read a few properties from the App Web web site (the SPWeb provisioned by SharePoint when installing an app)
I had to play around a lot but I finally found the solution:</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/operating-system-compatibility/>Operating system compatibility of SharePoint 2010/2013 has evolved</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 11, 2014</span>

A support of 2012R2 at last ! Both service packs bring support for Windows Server 2012R2. This is a recurrent problematic for IT services. How to reduce the number of different versions of an operating system in order to make maintenance cheaper and easier?
Warning: “in place” upgrade of operating system for SharePoint 2013 is not supported by Microsoft.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/repackaging-of-sharepoint-2010/>Repackaging of SharePoint 2010 language packs</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 8, 2014</span>
<span>2 min.</span></p><p>SharePoint 2010 service pack 2 came out a few months ago from now. It brings lot of new things, I’ll blog about that in further posts.
One of these new things is the repackaging of language packs.
Indeed you may have missed it but it is not required anymore to do a progressive installation in order to support MUI in SharePoint 2010 when setting up a new farm.
Before, when one wanted to install language packs (let’s take for example French English and Spanish), one had to:</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/march-update-of-visual-studio/>March Update of Visual Studio tools for Office</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 6, 2014</span>

This update integrates SP1’s benefits. It also allows you to develop app for PowerPoint and Access, enhances/add creation/configuration wizards for projects elements and includes more data sources types.
You can find the detailed description of the update here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn610877.aspx

Moreover, I’m a real chatterbox which does not help in that case. I finally decided to write a trilogy. I will publish one article every two days beginning today. The code sample will be delivered with last article so I ensure that you read everything ;-).</p></div></article></ul></div></section><footer class=footer><div class=container><nav class=level></nav><nav class=level><div class="level-left has-text-centered"><div class=level-item><form class="control has-icons has-icons-right" method=get action=https://duckduckgo.com><input class=input type=text name=q maxlength=255 placeholder=Search>
