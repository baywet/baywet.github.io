For those of you who do not follow me on social media and don’t know it yet, I honored to announce I’ve be renewed as a Microsoft MVP for year 2016.
Due to recent modifications in the program, I’m transitioning to Office Servers and Services
I’m really excited by this upcoming year of coding, sharing, conferences and meeting people!!
See you soon</description></item></channel></rss>
