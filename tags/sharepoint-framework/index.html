<span>1 min.</span></p><p>I was invited to demonstrate the new Office 365 CLI externalize command during on the of recent PnP calls.
You can watch the full call here
As a reminder this new command allows you to scan a SPFx project and get the external configuration automatically. Doing this reduces greatly the size of your solutions, improving performances for end users.
You can watch the command in action below and read the documentation here.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-dc-2019-04-18-07-35-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Fest DC 2019</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Apr 18, 2019</span>

<span>1 min.</span></p><p>It is the second time in a few years I have the ooportunity to speak at the SharePoint Saturday Houston.
I’ll give a speech about &ldquo;Automating Provisioning For Your Digital Workplace: With Azure Durable Functions & Microsoft Graph&rdquo;
Together we will see how you can improve your provisioning workflows and automate most of it leveragingAzure Durable Functions and the Microsoft Graph. This session is geared mostly towards developers but also for IT pros and deciders that want to gain insights on how to combine business processes and provisioning.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-180-and-u/>SharePoint Framework 1.8.0 and unit testing: bad Karma</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 29, 2019</span>
<span>2 min.</span></p><p>Sorry, I had to make the pun…. When the SharePoint Framework originally shipped, the tooling included KarmaJSto write unit tests.
KarmaJS received a lot of complaints about performance, capabilities, modern JavaScript support… This especially if you use is in combination with PhantomJS, a headless web browser project that has been abandoned a long time ago now which also shipped with SPFx.
While some peoplehave been arguing for a choice in unit testing framework with SPFx like we (almost) have choice in web frameworks, we saw little movement on that front over the last years.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-and-devop/>SharePoint Framework and DevOps Practices: New Documentation, New Samples</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jan 15, 2019</span>
<span>4 min.</span></p><p>TL; DR; With the release of Azure DevOps, there’s some new SPFX documentation to set up your CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps. Have a look and share your thoughts. Your feedback is always welcome! The Patterns and Practices Initiative also includes a newly reorganized DevOps repository for tools and samples around SharePoint Framework Build and Deploy Practices.
The long story My journey into the SharePoint DevOps world I have been working around Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD) and DevOps practices in the SharePoint/Azure/Office 365 ecosystem for several years.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/presenting-at-the-microsoft-ig/>Presenting at the Microsoft Ignite Tour Toronto</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jan 3, 2019</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>The Microsoft Ignite tour is a series of events that take place in cities around the world. This series of events is organized by Microsoft and presenters are picked among Microsoft Employees, Regional Directors and MVPs.
I’ll have the opportunity to present one session “How to do DevOps with the SharePoint Framework and why it matters?”. During this session we will explore together how you can setup your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline leveraging Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services).</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-granite-state-shar/>Speaking at Granite State SharePoint Users Group</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Dec 31, 2018</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>On January the 3rd I’ve been invited to speak (virtually) at the Granite State SharePoint Users group. I’ll be presenting the session “The Microsoft Graph and the SharePoint Framework on steroids with Azure Functions”.
This session will demonstrate how you can tap into a wealth of data and insights from the Microsoft Graph, interact with the user using the SharePoint Framework and extend components with complex line of business logic leveraging serverless Azure Functions.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-11-20-09-00-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Toronto 2018</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Nov 20, 2018</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Toronto.
I’ll give a speech about “Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework”.
Together we will see how you can transition from either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-10-10-08-00-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa 2018</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Oct 10, 2018</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Ottawa. It has become a regular event for me. This SPS is really dear to me because not only I get to see a lot of Canadian MVPs friends but it also was the first event ever I was presenting in (a broken) English a long time ago.
This year I&rsquo;ll present &ldquo;The Microsoft Graph and SharePoint Framework under steroids with Azure functions&rdquo; or how these three technologies really represent a power trio to build customizations in Office 365.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/>New SharePoint Framework PnP Samples available: using the Skype UCWA Web SDK to subscribe to people’s status</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jan 8, 2018</span>
<span>3 min.</span></p><p>TL;DR; I added two new SharePoint framework WebParts PnP sample to demonstrate how to use the Unified Communications Web API JavaScript SDK from Skype for business.

<span>2 min.</span></p><p>TL; DR; Microsoft replaced @types/es6-collections by the es2015.collection library in version 1.4.0 of the packages. Those had a conflicting definition of weakmap which caused issues with packages like lodash.
Long version Microsoft recently release v1.4.0 of the SharePoint Framwork and it’s packages. It contains a lot of improvements and one of those probably went unnoticed by many of us.
@types/es6-collections has been replaced by es2015.collection library (native, comes with the compiler/JS Engines).</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-09-07-08-00-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa 2017</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Sep 7, 2017</span>

I’ll give a speech about the graph “Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework ”. We&rsquo;ll see how you can migrate your existing investments in SharePoint development (either full trust solutions or add-ins) to the new SharePoint framework. Migrating these components will not only help you make sure you stay ahead of the technology but will also improve users experience and help migrating to Office 365.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-07-06-08-00-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday New York City 2017</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jul 6, 2017</span>

<span>1 min.</span></p><p>If you&rsquo;re following the SharePoint community, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of the &ldquo;SharePoint framework in his own words&rdquo; video series. https://www.voitanos.io/ is behind that initiative
( @andrewconnell founded voitanos recently)
The idea is to get the thoughts from the community and people who have been around the SharePoint development for a few years. If you don&rsquo;t know that series I&rsquo;d encourage you to check it out and I also hope that the product team behind the framework is listening the that super valuable feedback.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/update-to-sppagecontextinfo-ty/>Update to _spPageContextInfo type definitions - new properties available</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jun 16, 2017</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>If you&rsquo;re building modern SharePoint components (Framework or not), there&rsquo;s a high chance you&rsquo;re using TypeScript.
In that case you&rsquo;re probably using @types/SharePoint to provide auto-completion as well as some level of understanding for the compiler of what&rsquo;s going on.
There&rsquo;s one object in particular that SharePoint hydrates for us to give some understanding of where the user is and what he/she is doing: _spPageContextInfo.
A lot of properties were missing in those type definitions, old stuff like the web Id but also new things coming from SharePoint Online like canUserCreateMicrosoftForm.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/>Speaking at Techorama Belgium 2017</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Apr 26, 2017</span>
