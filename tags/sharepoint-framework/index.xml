&lt;p>As a reminder this new command allows you to scan a SPFx project and get the external configuration automatically.
Doing this reduces greatly the size of your solutions, improving performances for end users.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s the 3rd model Microsoft has come with to customize SharePoint in less than 5 years. You may still have add-ins/apps or even solutions running in production and you’re asking yourself what to do about all that?
Do you have to start all over again? And for how long that new model will last?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Houston 2019</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2019-04-02-02-00-00/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2019-04-02-02-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is the second time in a few years I have the ooportunity to speak at the SharePoint Saturday Houston.&lt;/p>

When the SharePoint Framework originally shipped, the tooling included &lt;a href="https://github.com/karma-runner/karma">KarmaJS&lt;/a>to write unit tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KarmaJS received a lot of complaints about performance, capabilities, modern JavaScript support… This especially if you use is in combination with &lt;a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs">PhantomJS&lt;/a>, a headless web browser project that has been abandoned a long time ago now which also shipped with SPFx.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While some people&lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/736">have been arguing for a choice in unit testing framework with SPFx&lt;/a> like we (almost) have choice in web frameworks, we saw little movement on that front over the last years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SharePoint Framework and DevOps Practices: New Documentation, New Samples</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-and-devop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-and-devop/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With the release of Azure DevOps, there’s some &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/toolchain/implement-ci-cd-with-azure-devops">new SPFX documentation&lt;/a> to set up your CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps.  Have a look and share your thoughts.  Your feedback is always welcome! The Patterns and Practices Initiative also includes a newly reorganized DevOps repository for tools and samples around &lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-build-extensions">SharePoint Framework Build and Deploy Practices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have been working around Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD) and DevOps practices in the SharePoint/Azure/Office 365 ecosystem for several years.  In my experience, whether you’re working alone or as part of a team, adopting proper ALM practices is crucial if you want to produce high quality code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Presenting at the Microsoft Ignite Tour Toronto</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/presenting-at-the-microsoft-ig/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/presenting-at-the-microsoft-ig/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Microsoft Ignite tour is a series of events that take place in cities around the world.

&lt;p>Together we will see how you can transition from &lt;strong>either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach&lt;/strong>. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-10-10-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-10-10-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Ottawa. It has become a regular event for me. This SPS is really dear to me because not only I get to see a lot of Canadian MVPs friends but it also was the first event ever I was presenting in (a broken) English a long time ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year I&amp;rsquo;ll present &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>The Microsoft Graph and SharePoint Framework under steroids with Azure functions&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; or how these three technologies really represent a &lt;strong>power trio to build customizations in Office 365&lt;/strong>. Together we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to leverage the&lt;strong>Graph to access your company&amp;rsquo;s data, how to leverage the SharePoint Framework to access the Graph&lt;/strong> and build user centric applications as well as how to leverage Microsoft Graph connected &lt;strong>Azure Functions via the SharePoint Framework to implement your line of business logic&lt;/strong> with backend processing capabilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New SharePoint Framework PnP Samples available: using the Skype UCWA Web SDK to subscribe to people’s status</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tldr">TL;DR;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I added two new SharePoint framework WebParts PnP sample to demonstrate how to use the Unified Communications Web API JavaScript SDK from Skype for business. This SDK allows you to do things like subscribe to a person status, start instant messaging conversations, calls…&lt;/p>

Those had a conflicting definition of weakmap which caused issues with packages like &lt;a href="https://lodash.com/">lodash&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="long-version">Long version&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Microsoft recently release v1.4.0 of the SharePoint Framwork and it’s packages. It contains a lot of improvements and one of those probably went unnoticed by many of us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>@types/es6-collections has been replaced by es2015.collection library (native, comes with the compiler/JS Engines). That package had a “special” definition of WeakMap (among other things) which was causing numerous packages not to work properly, include one of my favorites: lodash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-09-07-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-09-07-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Ottawa.&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ll see how you can migrate your existing investments in SharePoint development (either full trust solutions or add-ins) to the new SharePoint framework.

&lt;p>In that case you&amp;rsquo;re probably using @types/SharePoint to provide auto-completion as well as some level of understanding for the compiler of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s one object in particular that SharePoint hydrates for us to give some understanding of where the user is and what he/she is doing: _spPageContextInfo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of properties were missing in those type definitions, old stuff like the web Id but also new things coming from SharePoint Online like canUserCreateMicrosoftForm.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at Techorama Belgium 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</guid><description>&lt;p>Techorama is a 2-day event that takes place in Antwerp, Belgium from May 22nd to May 24th.&lt;/p>
