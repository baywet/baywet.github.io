When the SharePoint Framework originally shipped, the tooling included KarmaJSto write unit tests.
KarmaJS received a lot of complaints about performance, capabilities, modern JavaScript support… This especially if you use is in combination with PhantomJS, a headless web browser project that has been abandoned a long time ago now which also shipped with SPFx.
While some peoplehave been arguing for a choice in unit testing framework with SPFx like we (almost) have choice in web frameworks, we saw little movement on that front over the last years.</description></item><item><title>SharePoint Framework and DevOps Practices: New Documentation, New Samples</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-and-devop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-and-devop/</guid><description>TL; DR; With the release of Azure DevOps, there’s some new SPFX documentation to set up your CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps. Have a look and share your thoughts. Your feedback is always welcome!

Those had a conflicting definition of weakmap which caused issues with packages like lodash.
Long version Microsoft recently release v1.4.0 of the SharePoint Framwork and it’s packages. It contains a lot of improvements and one of those probably went unnoticed by many of us.
@types/es6-collections has been replaced by es2015.collection library (native, comes with the compiler/JS Engines).</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-09-07-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-09-07-08-00-00/</guid><description>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Ottawa.

The idea is to get the thoughts from the community and people who have been around the SharePoint development for a few years. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know that series I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to check it out and I also hope that the product team behind the framework is listening the that super valuable feedback.</description></item><item><title>Update to _spPageContextInfo type definitions - new properties available</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/update-to-sppagecontextinfo-ty/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2017 07:07:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/update-to-sppagecontextinfo-ty/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re building modern SharePoint components (Framework or not), there&amp;rsquo;s a high chance you&amp;rsquo;re using TypeScript.
In that case you&amp;rsquo;re probably using @types/SharePoint to provide auto-completion as well as some level of understanding for the compiler of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.
There&amp;rsquo;s one object in particular that SharePoint hydrates for us to give some understanding of where the user is and what he/she is doing: _spPageContextInfo.
A lot of properties were missing in those type definitions, old stuff like the web Id but also new things coming from SharePoint Online like canUserCreateMicrosoftForm.</description></item><item><title>Speaking at Techorama Belgium 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</guid><description>Techorama is a 2-day event that takes place in Antwerp, Belgium from May 22nd to May 24th.
