We’re developing a intranet for one of our customer and that solution partially relies on publishing features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a reminder, image renditions were introduced back in 2013 to help you serve the most optimized version of an image without having the information workers caring about sizes and whatnot or without you having to resize images with code.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Provisioning custom services for SharePoint</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/provisioning-custom-services-f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2015 03:24:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/provisioning-custom-services-f/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article is targeting SharePoint full trust developers who have (will) developed a custom service (SPService) for SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you are building a product for SharePoint like we’re doing at Negotium (&lt;a href="https://www.oceanik.com/"&gt;www.oceanik.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theattributesolution.com/"&gt;www.theattributesolution.com&lt;/a&gt; ) you probably built a custom service application within your solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case your custom service application probably relies on a dedicated custom SharePoint service to run its code (it can be a service within IIS or a windows service).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
