&lt;p&gt;DEV104 - Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the 3rd model Microsoft has come with to customize SharePoint in less than 5 years. You may still have add-ins/apps or even solutions running in production and you’re asking yourself what to do about all that?
Do you have to start all over again? And for how long that new model will last?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Houston 2019</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2019-04-02-02-00-00/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2019-04-02-02-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is the second time in a few years I have the ooportunity to speak at the SharePoint Saturday Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

It has become a regular event for me. This SPS is really dear to me because not only I get to see a lot of Canadian MVPs friends but it also was the first event ever I was presenting in (a broken) English a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;ll present &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;The Microsoft Graph and SharePoint Framework under steroids with Azure functions&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; or how these three technologies really represent a &lt;strong&gt;power trio to build customizations in Office 365&lt;/strong&gt;. Together we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to leverage the&lt;strong&gt;Graph to access your company&amp;rsquo;s data, how to leverage the SharePoint Framework to access the Graph&lt;/strong&gt; and build user centric applications as well as how to leverage Microsoft Graph connected &lt;strong&gt;Azure Functions via the SharePoint Framework to implement your line of business logic&lt;/strong&gt; with backend processing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Fest Seattle 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-se/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-se/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SharePoint Fest Seattle 2018 is happening from August 20th to 24th&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="azr203---azure-functions-in-the-real-world-lessons-learned--best-practices"&gt;AZR203 - Azure Functions In The Real World: Lessons Learned &amp;amp; Best Practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Azure Functions is one of the most powerful new solutions provided by Microsoft. Customers are leveraging it, and it has generally been available for a year now quietly delivering value across hundreds of projects. Many of you are probably asking yourself questions like “are functions mature enough?” or “are they production ready?” or even “is the right tooling here yet?” when considering this option for your projects.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Brussels 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-07-13-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-07-13-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give a speech about the Azure functions and Microsoft flow “&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Azure Functions and Flow&lt;/strong&gt;”.
Flow and Azure Functions are two new tools you now have for rapid applications development. It’s a revolution that changes the way of building and delivering modern applications. Instead of shipping a monolithic bloc, which can take up to a few months, we’ll now deliver each feature as a part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
