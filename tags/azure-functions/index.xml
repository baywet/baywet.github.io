&lt;p>I’ll give a speech about the Azure functions and Microsoft flow “&lt;strong>Introduction to Azure Functions and Flow&lt;/strong>”.

Instead of shipping a monolithic bloc, which can take up to a few months, we’ll now deliver each feature as a part of the solution.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
