&lt;h2 id="good-bye-negotium"&gt;Good Bye Negotium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I joined AlphaMosaik more than four years ago (&lt;a href="https://baywet.github.io/default/b/vincent/posts/c-est-parti-pour-18-mois"&gt;I originally joined only for 18 months huh&lt;/a&gt;…), by the acquisition by Negotium and up to this day my working environment and the company I was part of changed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company allowed me to maturate and to learn a lot on cultural, personal and professional aspects. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank everybody I had the occasion to work with during this period of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
