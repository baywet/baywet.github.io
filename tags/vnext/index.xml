&lt;p>Microsoft announced at the SharePoint Conference 2014 infopath&amp;rsquo;s discontinuity. They have not yet announced a successor to this technology since it is still under development on their side. (or maybe not even started to develop).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you have ideas / opinions, feel free to submit these.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
