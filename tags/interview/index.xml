( @andrewconnell founded voitanos recently)
The idea is to get the thoughts from the community and people who have been around the SharePoint development for a few years. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know that series I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to check it out and I also hope that the product team behind the framework is listening the that super valuable feedback.</description></item></channel></rss>
