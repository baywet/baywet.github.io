(I’m thinking in particular about ScriptLink actions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be in a situation where the code you need to run will be different depending on the experience being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of research, here is an example of solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>.Net Library for Alchemy API</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/net-library-for-alchemy-api/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/net-library-for-alchemy-api/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/net-library-for-alchemy-api/82.png" alt="82.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been several months I’ve been “playing” with multiple semantic analysis services. I especially discovered &lt;a href="https://www.alchemyapi.com/"&gt;www.alchemyapi.com&lt;/a&gt; in April. One interested thing about them being that IBM recently acquired them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is semantic analysis? It’s analyzing text data (or sometimes pictures too) and trying to understand the meaning of the content in order to extract metadata from it. It’s a little lit if I were to give you a document and ask you to read it and say “what concepts is it about? What entities (persons, cities, places, dates…)? etc.”. The ultimate goal being to extract everything automatically.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
