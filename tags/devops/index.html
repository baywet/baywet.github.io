<span>2 min.</span></p><p>Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) provides great Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) functionalities you can leverage to implement DevOps pipelines and automation with your custom developments.
If your custom solutions rely on PnP PowerShell during their build and/or deployment processes, you will need PnP PowerShell to be installed on the agent. Unfortunately the Hosted Agents do not have PnP PowerShell installed by default. Note: that documentation only applies to the Hosted and Hosted 2017 agents, the Linux Hosted Agent is not supported at the moment</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-06-08-00-00/>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Conclusion</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Oct 6, 2017</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>Installing and setting up SonarQube may seem quite complex and tedious.
I hope that this series has helped you to go faster implementing it.
Now, you can clearly identify your technical debt and take actions to improve the quality of your developments.
It is obvious that when a thousand problems appear in the code at once, it can be discouraging, just keep this in mind:
There are false positives, make a first pass to ignore/exclude those</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-04-08-00-00/>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Bonus SonarLint extension configuration</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Oct 4, 2017</span>

Installing the extension
Just go to https://www.sonarlint.org/VisualStudio/index.html and proceed with the installation.
Binding the Visual Studio solution to the SonarQube analysis From the Team Explorer click SonarQube
Click on connect.
(if you obtain a certificate error, you must install the self-signed certificate of the SonarQube server on your machine)</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-10-02-08-00-00/>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Monitoring the results</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Oct 2, 2017</span>

Information incorporated with the build When displaying the details of a build, you&rsquo;ll now find a new section dedicated to SonarQube. Within that section, besides the quality badge, you&rsquo;ll also find a link to the static analysis results details.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-29-08-00-00qwqw/>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Creating the SonarQube project</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Sep 29, 2017</span>

You can configure a SQ project for each code repository or even for each branch to have different deltas. (ex my master builds every month, I want to see changes to the monthly and my dev builds daily so I want to see evolution on a day by day basis).
Creating the project Go to &ldquo;configuration&rdquo;-> &ldquo;Projects&rdquo;-> &ldquo;Management&rdquo; then &ldquo;create project&rdquo;.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-29-08-00-00labd/>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Updating your build definitions</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Sep 29, 2017</span>
<span>2 min.</span></p><p>TL; DR Static analysis will be executed when building your source base using the central build machine. You have two options to set this up with VSTS:
Your project is &ldquo;Visual Studio" related and leverages sln and cs/vb proj files: in that case you can leverage integrated pre and post build tasks provided by the SonarQube VSTS extension. Your project is not build using msbuild: in that case you must leverage the SonarQube CLI task.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-27-08-00-00/>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Creating and configuring a service account for VSTS in SonarQube</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Sep 27, 2017</span>

Creating the service account From SonarQube, go to administration, security, users, and add an account.
Next click on the &ldquo;tokens" cell for the account we just created an generate a new personal access token.

<span>1 min.</span></p><p>TL; DR We will install and configure an add-on to delegate authentication to Azure Active Directory. This will allow our developers to use the same account between Visual Studio Team Services and SonarQube.
Configuration of the authentication module
Since version 5.4 SonarQube provides an additional plugin relying on the OAuth protocol to communicate with AAD. This will allow the users to leverage their corporate account to access SonarQube, providing SSO and simplifying the administrators job by having a central identity repository.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-20-08-00-00/>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Opening SonarQube’s ports</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Sep 20, 2017</span>

Introduction to static analysis The principle of static analysis is to take advantage of rules set more or less complex, those will detect patterns in the code that are problematic, categorize their importance and suggest a resolution.
A few examples:</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-your-technical-debt-2017-09-06-08-00-00/>Determine your technical debt using SonarQube - Introduction</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Sep 6, 2017</span>

Preamble There is bad quality code in every development project. This goes from the quick and dirty hack we are not proud of, to the long-forgotten code written by a developer who quit the company.
The problem with this code is that it will eventually accumulate and slow down the pace of new features delivery.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-07-06-08-00-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday New York City 2017</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jul 6, 2017</span>

I’ve been able to replace most of my scripts using VSTS DNX Tasks</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-07-30-09-28-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday New York City 2016</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jul 30, 2016</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>This year I have the privilege to speak at SPS New York City.
I’ll give a speech about “setting up your release pipeline for office 365/SharePoint”.
We’ll see together how you can leverage azure and visual studio team services to implement devops processes and increase quality and save time.
I&rsquo;ll also be giving Sebastien Levert&rsquo;s session “deep dive in Microsoft graph” as he can&rsquo;t make it to the event.
If you’re in the area today (I know it&rsquo;s short notice) don’t hesitate to register to the event.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/git-migration-cleaning-up-tfs/>Git Migration – cleaning up TFS references</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jan 11, 2016</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>I recently had to migrate multiple source repositories from TFS to GIT (Git on vsonline). To do so I used Git Tfs https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs which does the job and is well documented https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/blob/master/doc/usecases/migrate_tfs_to_git.md
There’s one step where they instruct you to remove *.vspscc and *.vssscc files and to clean up *.sln and *.*proj files from TFS references.
This will prevent Visual Studio from trying to reconnect to TFS every time you open the project/solution.</p></div></article></ul></div></section><footer class=footer><div class=container><nav class=level></nav><nav class=level><div class="level-left has-text-centered"><div class=level-item><form class="control has-icons has-icons-right" method=get action=https://bing.com><input class=input type=text name=q maxlength=255 placeholder=Search>
