Ideally you’d like to run these unit tests in a continuous integration process in order to make sure you didn’t introduce any regression/bug or degraded performances.
In .NET world you have many tools to write unit tests:
MSTest/VSTest
NUnit
xUnit</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/git-migration-cleaning-up-tfs/>Git Migration – cleaning up TFS references</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jan 11, 2016</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>I recently had to migrate multiple source repositories from TFS to GIT (Git on vsonline). To do so I used Git Tfs https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs which does the job and is well documented https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/blob/master/doc/usecases/migrate_tfs_to_git.md
There’s one step where they instruct you to remove *.vspscc and *.vssscc files and to clean up *.sln and *.*proj files from TFS references.
This will prevent Visual Studio from trying to reconnect to TFS every time you open the project/solution.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/automatically-increment-sharep/>Automatically increment SharePoint feature version number during build with build 2015</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Nov 18, 2015</span>

If you followed my posts you must have noticed you dll’s were built but you didn’t have any wsp.
This is because by default msbuild doesn’t package your solutions. That’s pity isn’t it?
Here is some documentation telling us to add IsPackaging=true to the build definition as a parameter.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/visual-studio-2013-update-4-an/>Visual studio 2013 Update 4 and SharePoint full trust solutions automated build</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Dec 1, 2014</span>
