I’ll give a speech about the SharePoint Framework and devops methodologies “Is it possible to do devops with the SharePoint framework?”.
You had it all right with solutions and add-ins. Your release pipeline was set up. Do new technologies and methodologies mean starting over?
Don’t panic I’m here to help! Together we’ll see how to set up a devops pipeline for SPFX developments with:</description></item><item><title>New tasks to build/release dotnetcore project with vsts</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 14:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/new-tasks-to-buildrelease-dotn/</guid><description>A few months ago I wrote a series of articles on how to set up a release pipeline for dnx/dotnetcore projects with vsts targeting azure web apps.
This series would require you to use a few scripts to build and publish the website executing them using powershell tasks in the build definition.
You don’t need to do that anymore because two new extensions are available on the marketplace:

I also had the occasion to help organize the event this year, it’s been an interesting experience so far and I’d like to thank Serge, Nico, Luc, Seb and Fabrice for their implication in that project, it’s much more work than what we think!

Ideally you’d like to run these unit tests in a continuous integration process in order to make sure you didn’t introduce any regression/bug or degraded performances.
In .NET world you have many tools to write unit tests:
MSTest/VSTest
NUnit
xUnit</description></item><item><title>Git Migration – cleaning up TFS references</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/git-migration-cleaning-up-tfs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/git-migration-cleaning-up-tfs/</guid><description>I recently had to migrate multiple source repositories from TFS to GIT (Git on vsonline). To do so I used Git Tfs https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs which does the job and is well documented https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/blob/master/doc/usecases/migrate_tfs_to_git.md
There’s one step where they instruct you to remove *.vspscc and *.vssscc files and to clean up *.sln and *.*proj files from TFS references.
This will prevent Visual Studio from trying to reconnect to TFS every time you open the project/solution.</description></item><item><title>Automatically increment SharePoint feature version number during build with build 2015</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/automatically-increment-sharep/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/automatically-increment-sharep/</guid><description>A few months ago Microsoft released a new automated build system with visual studio online /tfs 2015.
This new mechanism is way more open than previous XAML builds, tasks based and easier to customize.
One of the available tasks allows you to run a powershell script.
Let’s say that for one reason you want to increment automatically the version number of your SharePoint features when building.

If you followed my posts you must have noticed you dll’s were built but you didn’t have any wsp.
This is because by default msbuild doesn’t package your solutions. That’s pity isn’t it?
Here is some documentation telling us to add IsPackaging=true to the build definition as a parameter.</description></item><item><title>Visual studio 2013 Update 4 and SharePoint full trust solutions automated build</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/visual-studio-2013-update-4-an/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 00:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/visual-studio-2013-update-4-an/</guid><description>Quick update on my serie about automated build for sharepoint full trust solutions.

When doing SharePoint development we have to sign assemblies with a certificate. When the project is initialized there are two options:
Certificate is protected by a password: (pfx extension) that was with first versions of SharePoint tooling, or if you have created the structure of (visual studio) solution yourself with several assemblies.</description></item></channel></rss>
