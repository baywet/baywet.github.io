&lt;p&gt;We decided to make all the labs available under PnP for you to learn new technologies and patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow the steps described in the labs, you will learn about technologies like Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, the Microsoft Graph, Azure Durable Functions, SharePoint WebHook, PnP Provisioning and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Recording available PnP Call December 5th - Office 365 CLI externalize</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/recording-available-pnp-call-d/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2019 10:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/recording-available-pnp-call-d/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to demonstrate the new Office 365 CLI externalize command during on the of recent PnP calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Microsoft Graph open extensions (currently starting a project using those at 2toLead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Calendar capabilities in the Microsoft Graph (and I shared a few tricks that might interested you if you plan on using those APIs)&lt;/li&gt;

They have a great content, great speakers (many folks from Microsoft or other MVPs) and if you haven’t booked your ticket yet, I suggest you do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be giving two sessions that are related:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Fest DC (Washington) 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-dc-2018-01-05-09-00-00/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-dc-2018-01-05-09-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SharePoint Fest DC (Washington) 2018 is happening from March 26th to March 30th&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Modern development means client side first, backend second.

&lt;p&gt;I’ll give a speech about the graph “Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework ”. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how you can migrate your existing investments in SharePoint development (either full trust solutions or add-ins) to the new SharePoint framework.

Instead of shipping a monolithic bloc, which can take up to a few months, we’ll now deliver each feature as a part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday New York City 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-07-06-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-07-06-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS NYC.

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to get the thoughts from the community and people who have been around the SharePoint development for a few years. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know that series I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to check it out and I also hope that the product team behind the framework is listening the that super valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at Techorama Belgium 2017</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Techorama is a 2-day event that takes place in Antwerp, Belgium from May 22nd to May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
