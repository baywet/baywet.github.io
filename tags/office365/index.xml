&lt;p&gt;We decided to make all the labs available under PnP for you to learn new technologies and patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow the steps described in the labs, you will learn about technologies like Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, the Microsoft Graph, Azure Durable Functions, SharePoint WebHook, PnP Provisioning and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at the European SharePoint Conference 2019 - SPFx &amp; DevOps</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-the-european-share-2019-10-01-18-14-00/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 18:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-the-european-share-2019-10-01-18-14-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The ESPC is one of the biggest technology events in Europe and the biggest with focus on Office 365, SharePoint and Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be speaking about “&lt;strong&gt;Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;It’s the 3rd model Microsoft has come with to customize SharePoint in less than 5 years.

&lt;p&gt;I’ll give a speech about the Azure functions and Microsoft flow “&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Azure Functions and Flow&lt;/strong&gt;”.
Flow and Azure Functions are two new tools you now have for rapid applications development. It’s a revolution that changes the way of building and delivering modern applications. Instead of shipping a monolithic bloc, which can take up to a few months, we’ll now deliver each feature as a part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re-awarded Microsoft MVP for year 2017 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/re-awarded-microsoft-mvp-for-y/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/re-awarded-microsoft-mvp-for-y/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You may not know it but Microsoft has changed the organization of the MVP program during these last few years.
They used to nominate new MVP’s every 3 months and renew people every year on anniversary date.
One of the changes the brought to the program is around the renew and nomination cycles. New MVP’s are awarded every month and existing ones are renewed all together every year in July.
I used to be an “April MVP” and I was used to blogging about my renewal in April.
I’m pleased to announce I’ve been renewed MVP for year 2017-2018 on the Office Servers and Services category.
Let’s go for another year :)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa 2016</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-11-29-14-00-00/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-11-29-14-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message behind that is Microsoft is investing in the community and wants to create a single place where developers (from any platform) can meet to participate in the projects together and share content.

&lt;p&gt;Auto-hosted apps are &lt;strong&gt;only available for SharePoint online&lt;/strong&gt; (office 365), it bundles and provisions at each installation an &lt;strong&gt;azure web site&lt;/strong&gt;(and eventually a sql azure database).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made &lt;strong&gt;hosting&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tenancy management&lt;/strong&gt; (isolating customers’ data) and &lt;strong&gt;authentication&lt;/strong&gt;way easier because most of the configuration part was automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed. The potential cost overhead will be billed directly to the tenant owner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
