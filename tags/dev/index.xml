&lt;p>I’ll give a speech about “&lt;strong>Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework&lt;/strong>”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together we will see how you can transition from &lt;strong>either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach&lt;/strong>. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guest on the Microsoft Graph Community call (June): The Online Meeting Solution</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-graph-c/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-graph-c/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-graph-c/5.PNG" alt="5.PNG">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I must admit I’ve not been on page lately for the blog posts. However, I had the privilege (among other great speakers) to present during the Microsoft Graph Community call for the month of June.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft Graph Community calls are online webinar organized by the Microsoft Graph Team. The Team usually presents announcements and then allows time for community speakers to presents discoveries, real life solutions and lessons learnt with the Microsoft Graph. Those call are free to attend and if you’re not already registered, &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/events/?filterBy=Webcasts">here is all the information you need&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guest on the Microsoft 365 Dev Podcast: Microsoft Graph Open Extensions and Calendering</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-365-dev/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-365-dev/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I had the honor to be a guest on the Microsoft 365 Dev Podcast hosted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jthake">Jeremy Thake&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulschaeflein">Paul Schaeflein&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was the second time I was invited on a podcast (t&lt;a href="https://baywet.github.io/default/b/vincent/posts/entrevue-avec-le-visual-studio-talk-show---sonarqube">he first one being in French about devops&lt;/a>), this is a fun exercise where the content is delivered as a discussion between the hosts and the guests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this episode we discussed about two main topics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Microsoft Graph open extensions (currently starting a project using those at 2toLead)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Calendar capabilities in the Microsoft Graph (and I shared a few tricks that might interested you if you plan on using those APIs)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I’d like to thank Jeremy and Paul for giving me this opportunity and for the good conversations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Internet Explorer compatibility mode is changing on SharePoint Online</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/internet-explorer-compatibilit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/internet-explorer-compatibilit/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-history-being-this-situation">The history being this situation….&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Internet Explorer has been a corporate browser for two decades now. And many of us remember the dark ages of web development when we needed to have “IE compatible code” and “web compatible code”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As many companies invested deeply in the browser building portals that worked with specific versions, Microsoft provided a decade ago a compatibility mode, allowing the browser to “behave” like a former version of itself and stay compatible with websites that had not been updated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using PnP PowerShell on Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Hosted Agent</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/using-pnp-powershell-on-visual/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2017 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/using-pnp-powershell-on-visual/</guid><description>&lt;p>Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) provides great Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) functionalities you can leverage to implement DevOps pipelines and automation with your custom developments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your custom solutions rely on PnP PowerShell during their build and/or deployment processes, you will need PnP PowerShell to be installed on the agent.
Unfortunately the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/agents/hosted">Hosted Agents&lt;/a> do not have PnP PowerShell installed by default.
&lt;em>Note: that documentation only applies to the Hosted and Hosted 2017 agents, the Linux Hosted Agent is not supported at the moment&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Determine whether or not a SharePoint library is running with the new experience</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/determine-whether-or-not-a-sha/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/determine-whether-or-not-a-sha/</guid><description>&lt;p>Microsoft just released the new experience for SharePoint libraries and I know a lot of you built custom look and feel and/or components on top of the library ui.

&lt;p>In order to do so, you need a 2016 dev machine (vs 2015 up to date with the latest version of the office sdk) and to install on top of that the office sdk preview 2.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And so while doing an “update-package” in nuget console or if you have a restore packages step in your build process.

&lt;p>And by impact financial I also mean the time spent to implement, because it is time that it not spent on its core business, or more generally to create added value.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating Team Foundation Server 2010 to Visual Studio Online: difference of process model</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/migrating-team-foundation-serv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2014 03:54:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/migrating-team-foundation-serv/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="context">Context&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This will bring many new opportunities and tools to our way of developing and it will allow our IT Department to decommission a (several in fact) machine.

&lt;p>What are you going to find there?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Examples of code made by Microsoft and the community&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Demonstrations presented during the sessions from Microsoft and the community&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Part of the &amp;lsquo;documents&amp;rsquo; sources for the MSDN documentation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SDK for &amp;rsquo;third&amp;rsquo; platforms (IOS, android&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>…&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The message behind that is Microsoft is investing in the community and wants to create a single place where developers (from any platform) can meet to participate in the projects together and share content. Therefore do not hesitate to have a look and to submit content / patches / projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anonymous access for SharePoint autohosted apps</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/anonymous-access-for-sharepoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2014 17:03:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/anonymous-access-for-sharepoin/</guid><description>&lt;p>These days I’ve been working on an auto hosted app for SharePoint (office 365 actually).&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wanted to publish this article months ago, back to the time I found this solution. But I did not mostly because of a lack of free time. Sebastien LEVERT, a top SharePoint developer and a member of Montreal’s SharePoint community, recently published a post about the same subject. Read it (sorry it’s in French), I’ll write my post so it is complementary. &lt;a href="https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/">https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reminders">Reminders&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To quickly summarize, when you develop SharePoint solutions and you want to support multiple languages (localize it) you need to use .net resources. These resx files are a mechanism coming from asp.net and work as a dictionary (key/value). You have to create one file by supported language. Instead of writing texts in the code (which is a bad practice anyway), you now reference these by defined keys.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boost your SharePoint solutions with distributed cache!–Part 2–Explanations tips and warnings</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-15-12-06-00/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 12:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-15-12-06-00/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="explanations-tips-tricks-and-warnings">Explanations, tips, tricks and warnings&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="explanations">Explanations&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This cache cluster is in facts made of appfabric hosts (caching services). One of the advantages is that hosts not members of the cluster but clients of it keep a local copy of objects. And this copy is automatically maintained up to date. The result is you do not need to implement a lazy loading pattern to avoid back and forth on the network.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SharePoint Auto hosted app and ASP.NET MVC</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-auto-hosted-app-and/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 04:16:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-auto-hosted-app-and/</guid><description>&lt;p>Code apps they said, it will be easier they said…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio 2013 comes with a new project model : SharePoint autohosted app ASP.NET MVC (Cool!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m fond of SharePoint, I like MVC, why not mixing them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed. The potential cost overhead will be billed directly to the tenant owner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Entity Framework and dataContext reference for a web application</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/entity-framework-and-dataconte/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2013 03:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/entity-framework-and-dataconte/</guid><description>&lt;p>When using the entity framework with a data context we often have this problematic:&lt;/p>
