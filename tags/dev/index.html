<span>1 min.</span></p><p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Toronto.
I’ll give a speech about “Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework”.
Together we will see how you can transition from either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/guest-on-the-microsoft-graph-c/>Guest on the Microsoft Graph Community call (June): The Online Meeting Solution</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Aug 4, 2018</span>

<span>2 min.</span></p><p>The history being this situation…. Internet Explorer has been a corporate browser for two decades now. And many of us remember the dark ages of web development when we needed to have “IE compatible code” and “web compatible code”.
As many companies invested deeply in the browser building portals that worked with specific versions, Microsoft provided a decade ago a compatibility mode, allowing the browser to “behave” like a former version of itself and stay compatible with websites that had not been updated.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/using-pnp-powershell-on-visual/>Using PnP PowerShell on Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Hosted Agent</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Oct 9, 2017</span>
<span>2 min.</span></p><p>Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) provides great Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) functionalities you can leverage to implement DevOps pipelines and automation with your custom developments.
If your custom solutions rely on PnP PowerShell during their build and/or deployment processes, you will need PnP PowerShell to be installed on the agent. Unfortunately the Hosted Agents do not have PnP PowerShell installed by default. Note: that documentation only applies to the Hosted and Hosted 2017 agents, the Linux Hosted Agent is not supported at the moment</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/determine-whether-or-not-a-sha/>Determine whether or not a SharePoint library is running with the new experience</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jun 14, 2016</span>

You might be in a situation where the code you need to run will be different depending on the experience being used.

In order to do so, you need a 2016 dev machine (vs 2015 up to date with the latest version of the office sdk) and to install on top of that the office sdk preview 2.

I had to grant an anonymous access to one of the pages without requiring clients to give anonymous access to their SharePoint site. But I still needed to read a few properties from the App Web web site (the SPWeb provisioned by SharePoint when installing an app)

This update integrates SP1’s benefits. It also allows you to develop app for PowerPoint and Access, enhances/add creation/configuration wizards for projects elements and includes more data sources types.
You can find the detailed description of the update here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn610877.aspx
It’s very simple to update your installation, open Visual Studio, tools, Extensions and updates.

One of the advantages is that hosts not members of the cluster but clients of it keep a local copy of objects. And this copy is automatically maintained up to date. The result is you do not need to implement a lazy loading pattern to avoid back and forth on the network.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-auto-hosted-app-and/>SharePoint Auto hosted app and ASP.NET MVC</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Nov 13, 2013</span>

I’m fond of SharePoint, I like MVC, why not mixing them?
Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed.

In this first case you wrote a static reference to the context.
