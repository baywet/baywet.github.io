I’ll give a speech about the multilingualism capabilities of SharePoint “Translating SharePoint from beginning to ending”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll talk about how you can successfully implement an multilingual intranet, team sites or public sites using SharePoint.&lt;/p>

This is a good occasion to expand your network, learn a lot of things and to spend a good day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Localizing JavaScript of a Full Trust solution</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/localizing-javascript-of-a-ful/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2014 03:58:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/localizing-javascript-of-a-ful/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h4>
