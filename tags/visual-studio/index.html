If you followed my posts you must have noticed you dll’s were built but you didn’t have any wsp.
This is because by default msbuild doesn’t package your solutions. That’s pity isn’t it?
Here is some documentation telling us to add IsPackaging=true to the build definition as a parameter.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/visual-studio-2013-update-4-an/>Visual studio 2013 Update 4 and SharePoint full trust solutions automated build</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Dec 1, 2014</span>

If you take a look at the second error I’m describing hereyou will notice that you have to replace two lines in order to make it work.
With update 4 it looks like Microsoft is preparing full 64 bits support for visual studio. New fix lines are now

With previous versions Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Search and Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Search.Applications dll’s were not included (it most likely has been forgotten)
You then had two solutions:
Ensure that all developers had SharePoint binaries installed on their machines Embed a copy of the dll taken from a SharePoint machine Both solutions were not very practical.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/automated-build-for-sharepoint-2014-10-29-02-22-54/>Automated build for SharePoint server (fulltrust) solutions with visual studio online</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Oct 29, 2014</span>

This service offers most of the features offered by the on premises version of Team Foundation Server 2013 and even some exclusive features.
If you have only a vague idea of what can do TFS2013/VSO and you want to learn more I very highly recommend Professional Application Lifecycle Management from Wrox.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/converting-a-protected-by-pass/>Converting a protected by password certificate (pfx) to an unprotected one (snk)</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Oct 4, 2014</span>
<span>3 min.</span></p><p>At work I am trying to implement automated build for SharePoint (full trust) projects on visual studio online. (Expect to have several articles about this as and when I meet and solve errors)
When doing SharePoint development we have to sign assemblies with a certificate. When the project is initialized there are two options:
Certificate is protected by a password: (pfx extension) that was with first versions of SharePoint tooling, or if you have created the structure of (visual studio) solution yourself with several assemblies.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/have-all-the-tools-of-a-first/>Have all the tools of a first class startup's in 10 min</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jul 3, 2014</span>

How to have effective working tools while minimizing the financial impact?
And by impact financial I also mean the time spent to implement, because it is time that it not spent on its core business, or more generally to create added value.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/migrating-team-foundation-serv/>Migrating Team Foundation Server 2010 to Visual Studio Online: difference of process model</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jun 30, 2014</span>

This will bring many new opportunities and tools to our way of developing and it will allow our IT Department to decommission a (several in fact) machine.

This update integrates SP1’s benefits. It also allows you to develop app for PowerPoint and Access, enhances/add creation/configuration wizards for projects elements and includes more data sources types.
You can find the detailed description of the update here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn610877.aspx
It’s very simple to update your installation, open Visual Studio, tools, Extensions and updates.
Have fun coding!</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-auto-hosted-app-and/>SharePoint Auto hosted app and ASP.NET MVC</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Nov 13, 2013</span>

I’m fond of SharePoint, I like MVC, why not mixing them?
Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed.
