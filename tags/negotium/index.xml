&lt;h2 id="good-bye-negotium">Good Bye Negotium&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since I joined AlphaMosaik more than four years ago (&lt;a href="https://baywet.github.io/default/b/vincent/posts/c-est-parti-pour-18-mois">I originally joined only for 18 months huh&lt;/a>…), by the acquisition by Negotium and up to this day my working environment and the company I was part of changed a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This company allowed me to maturate and to learn a lot on cultural, personal and professional aspects. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank everybody I had the occasion to work with during this period of time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
