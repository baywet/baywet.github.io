This is the first time I’ll be speaking at this event, but I’ve heard lots of good things about it from people who previously spoke there.
I’ll be presenting “Turbocharge your API integration with Microsoft Kiota” where I’ll be introducing through lots of demonstrations how you can generate a client generated for any OpenAPI described API using Microsoft Kiota and other tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
