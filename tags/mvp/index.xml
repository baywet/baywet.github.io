A slight change this time, my award is Office development.
Over the years I’ve been a SharePoint MVP, an Office Servers and Services MVP and now an Office development MVP.
Originally Microsoft had it’s MVPs organized by products, which made a lot of sense in a on premises world which required a deep knowledge in something very specific.</description></item><item><title>Re-awarded Microsoft MVP for year 2017 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/re-awarded-microsoft-mvp-for-y/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/re-awarded-microsoft-mvp-for-y/</guid><description>You may not know it but Microsoft has changed the organization of the MVP program during these last few years. They used to nominate new MVP’s every 3 months and renew people every year on anniversary date. One of the changes the brought to the program is around the renew and nomination cycles. New MVP’s are awarded every month and existing ones are renewed all together every year in July. I used to be an “April MVP” and I was used to blogging about my renewal in April.</description></item><item><title>Renewed as MVP for 2016</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/renewed-as-mvp-for-2016/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vbiret+blog@outlook.com (Vincent Biret)</author><guid>https://baywet.github.io/renewed-as-mvp-for-2016/</guid><description>Hi,
