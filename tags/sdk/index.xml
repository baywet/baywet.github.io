&lt;p&gt;Back in August 2020 I became the main maintainer of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-java"&gt;Microsoft Graph Java SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team had to deprioritize this SDK in favor of other languages due to a lack of staff. About 100+ issues were open, as well as 15 pull requests from the community. Dependencies and tooling had not been updated, the Android story was unclear, no innovation had been done in a long time, the repository felt abandoned and caused a lot of frustrations…&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My personal experience as a Program Manager and switching back to development</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/pm-experience-dev-sdk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/pm-experience-dev-sdk/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="switching-back-to-the-light-side-of-the-force-becoming-a-developer-again"&gt;Switching back to the light side of the force: becoming a developer again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently transitioned from &lt;strong&gt;Program Manager on Microsoft Graph&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Software Developer in the Microsoft Graph SDKs team&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my previous team for welcoming me these last 7 months and allowing me to experiment with the role of Program Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with you some of my experience and learnings as a Program Manager. Before you dive in, &lt;strong&gt;keep in mind this is my personal experience&lt;/strong&gt;, which may differ a lot from team to team, product to product and depend on other circumstances (being remote, cultural, etc&amp;hellip;). &lt;strong&gt;Do not take this article for a single source of truth&lt;/strong&gt;, there are other experiences that have been shared out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
