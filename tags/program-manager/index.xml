&lt;p&gt;I recently transitioned from &lt;strong&gt;Program Manager on Microsoft Graph&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Software Developer in the Microsoft Graph SDKs team&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my previous team for welcoming me these last 7 months and allowing me to experiment with the role of Program Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with you some of my experience and learnings as a Program Manager. Before you dive in, &lt;strong&gt;keep in mind this is my personal experience&lt;/strong&gt;, which may differ a lot from team to team, product to product and depend on other circumstances (being remote, cultural, etc&amp;hellip;). &lt;strong&gt;Do not take this article for a single source of truth&lt;/strong&gt;, there are other experiences that have been shared out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
