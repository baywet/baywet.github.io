&lt;p&gt;Together we will cover the basics of Microsoft Graph, the Microsoft Identity Platform, the value it provides to developers and how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the ongoing pandemic, the event will be digital only and held on Microsoft Teams. This means you can attend the event for free from anywhere in the world! The organizing team had been putting a lot of efforts into making sure attendees get the most of this digital format.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
