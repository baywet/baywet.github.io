&lt;p>This cache cluster is in facts made of appfabric hosts (caching services). One of the advantages is that hosts not members of the cluster but clients of it keep a local copy of objects. And this copy is automatically maintained up to date.

&lt;p>I started to write this set of articles as one at the beginning, but I quickly realized that I had a lot of things to explain. Moreover, I’m a real chatterbox which does not help in that case. I finally decided to write a trilogy. I will publish one article every two days beginning today. The code sample will be delivered with last article so I ensure that you read everything ;-). Have a nice reading and do not hesitate to comment.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
