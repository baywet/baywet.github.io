&lt;p>Entity Framework is a well-known technology in the ORM domain for the .NET world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Object Relational Mapping, this is the part between data persistence unit and some more “high level” code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you start a new entity framework project you have a few different ways to do it, one of which being “code first”. It means our code will drive the SQL Schema evolution (which simplifies a lot of things and allows you to focus on business and not technical implementation).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Office developers tools november 2014 update</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/office-developers-tools-novemb/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 01:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/office-developers-tools-novemb/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you work in SharePoint development you probably already have noticed that the tools are getting a new update.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With previous versions Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Search and Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Search.Applications dll’s were not included (it most likely has been forgotten)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You then had two solutions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ensure that all developers had SharePoint binaries installed on their machines&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Embed a copy of the dll taken from a SharePoint machine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both solutions were not very practical.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Service pack 2 for SharePoint 2010 and Service pack 1 for SharePoint 2013 recently came out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-support-of-2012r2-at-last-">A support of 2012R2 at last !&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Both service packs bring support for Windows Server 2012R2&lt;/strong>. This is a recurrent problematic for IT services. How to reduce the number of different versions of an operating system in order to make maintenance cheaper and easier?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warning: &lt;strong>“in place” upgrade of operating system for SharePoint 2013 is not supported by Microsoft&lt;/strong>. You need to reinstall the farm and migrate the content.
