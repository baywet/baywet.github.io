Growth in user base usually translates in growth in contributors, which in turns translates in a better solution bringing more users and so on&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;Maintaining large open-source repositories can be time-consuming&lt;/strong&gt; as you spend more and more time reviewing contributions. Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, that time spent reviewing pull requests is mostly well spent as it represents a factor of scale efficiency gain: for minutes spent reviewing any given pull request, the codebase benefits hours of development efforts invested by the contributor.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Automatically increment SharePoint feature version number during build with build 2015</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/automatically-increment-sharep/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/automatically-increment-sharep/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago Microsoft released a new automated build system with visual studio online /tfs 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
