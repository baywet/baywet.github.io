&lt;p&gt;An interesting particularity of this event, they move to a different European capital each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This years edition will be from &lt;strong&gt;December 2nd to 5th in Prague&lt;/strong&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m honored to be invited to speak again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting two sessions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do DevOps with the SharePoint Framework and why it matters?&lt;/strong&gt; This session will be an introduction to DevOps practices and an application of the core principles in a SharePoint Framework context.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SharePoint Framework and DevOps Practices: New Documentation, New Samples</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-and-devop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-framework-and-devop/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tl-dr"&gt;TL; DR;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of Azure DevOps, there’s some &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/toolchain/implement-ci-cd-with-azure-devops"&gt;new SPFX documentation&lt;/a&gt; to set up your CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps.  Have a look and share your thoughts.  Your feedback is always welcome! The Patterns and Practices Initiative also includes a newly reorganized DevOps repository for tools and samples around &lt;a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-build-extensions"&gt;SharePoint Framework Build and Deploy Practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-long-story"&gt;The long story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-journey-into-the-sharepoint-devops-world"&gt;My journey into the SharePoint DevOps world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working around Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD) and DevOps practices in the SharePoint/Azure/Office 365 ecosystem for several years.  In my experience, whether you’re working alone or as part of a team, adopting proper ALM practices is crucial if you want to produce high quality code.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at Granite State SharePoint Users Group</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-granite-state-shar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-granite-state-shar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On January the 3rd I’ve been invited to speak (virtually) at the Granite State SharePoint Users group. I’ll be presenting the session “&lt;strong&gt;The Microsoft Graph and the SharePoint Framework on steroids with Azure Functions&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will demonstrate how you can tap into a wealth of data and insights from the Microsoft Graph, interact with the user using the SharePoint Framework and extend components with complex line of business logic leveraging serverless Azure Functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday New England 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-27-05-00-00/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2018 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-27-05-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS New England.&lt;/p&gt;

I am delighted to announce I have been selected to speak at the European SharePoint Conference 2018. &lt;strong&gt;This event will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark from the 26th to the 29th of November.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be speaking about “&lt;strong&gt;Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;It’s the 3rd model Microsoft has come with to customize SharePoint in less than 5 years. You may still have add-ins/apps or even solutions running in production and you’re asking yourself what to do about all that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Pittsburgh 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-23-05-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2018 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-08-23-05-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I Have the pleasure to announce I have been selected to speak at SPS Pittsburgh 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give a speech about the graph “&lt;strong&gt;How to do Dev-Ops with the SharePoint Framework and why it matters&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together we’ll see why it’s important to follow the DevOps processes, methodologies, and philosophy and how to implement it for the SharePoint Framework with Visual Studio Team Services (or TFS). Go from the original idea to production automating as much as possible!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Fest Seattle 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-se/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-fest-se/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SharePoint Fest Seattle 2018 is happening from August 20th to 24th&lt;/strong&gt;. This event will feature 2 days pre-conference workshops and 3 days of conference. &lt;a href="https://www.sharepointfest.com/Seattle/"&gt;You can find more information about it on the website&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been selected amongst 74 other speakers (including people from Microsoft product teams!!) to present this year two sessions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="azr203---azure-functions-in-the-real-world-lessons-learned--best-practices"&gt;AZR203 - Azure Functions In The Real World: Lessons Learned &amp;amp; Best Practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Azure Functions is one of the most powerful new solutions provided by Microsoft. Customers are leveraging it, and it has generally been available for a year now quietly delivering value across hundreds of projects. Many of you are probably asking yourself questions like “are functions mature enough?” or “are they production ready?” or even “is the right tooling here yet?” when considering this option for your projects.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Not Office Servers and Services MVP anymore, becoming Office development MVP</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/not-office-servers-and-service/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/not-office-servers-and-service/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="6jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/not-office-servers-and-service/6.jpg" alt="6.jpg"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="renewed-as-mvp-and-changed-category"&gt;Renewed as MVP and changed category&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have the pleasure to announce I’ve been renewed as a Microsoft MVP&lt;/strong&gt;, for the fifth year in a row (time flies, I’m getting old). A slight change this time, &lt;strong&gt;my award is Office development&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve been a SharePoint MVP, an Office Servers and Services MVP and now an Office development MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally Microsoft had it’s MVPs organized by products, which made a lot of sense in a on premises world which required a deep knowledge in something very specific. Also, it allowed MVP’s to be connected directly with the teams at Microsoft on their product. However, &lt;strong&gt;over the last decade the industry transitioned to a cloud first model and somebody who was working with SharePoint&lt;/strong&gt; (or Exchange, Skype…) &lt;strong&gt;is most likely to be working with Office 365 at large&lt;/strong&gt; (and some Azure as well). A couple of years ago (3?) Microsoft decided to reorganize the MVP program to have award categories (Azure, Office servers and services, Visual Studio and Team Services…) which regroup contribution areas (e.g. OSS: SharePoint, Exchange, Office 365, …)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday New York City 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-06-27-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-06-27-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-06-27-08-00-00/8.jpg" alt="8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll give a speech about “&lt;strong&gt;Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together we will see how you can transition from either the server-side object model or the add-ins development fashions to the modern SharePoint Framework approach. This session is mostly meant for developers and technical architects who are curious about getting started on the new model and that might have legacy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Less than three weeks before the #SPSMontreal 2018!</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/less-than-three-weeks-before-t/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/less-than-three-weeks-before-t/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/less-than-three-weeks-before-t/9.jpg" alt="9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year again I have the privilege to be part of the organizing committee for SharePoint Saturday Montréal 2018 taking place June the 2nd at Cégep du vieux Montréal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s free, it’s the occasion to learn a lot, not only about SharePoint but also about Office 365 and Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year in a few numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 sessions (in English and French)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Keynote by the Great Serge Tremblay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 MSP (Microsoft Student Partner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 MCT (Microsoft Certified Trainers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200 attendees (planned)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the content, it’s also the occasion to develop your network, eat some Schwartz (smoked meat) and “SharePint” (Share a pint) !&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Internet Explorer compatibility mode is changing on SharePoint Online</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/internet-explorer-compatibilit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/internet-explorer-compatibilit/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-history-being-this-situation"&gt;The history being this situation….&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer has been a corporate browser for two decades now. And many of us remember the dark ages of web development when we needed to have “IE compatible code” and “web compatible code”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many companies invested deeply in the browser building portals that worked with specific versions, Microsoft provided a decade ago a compatibility mode, allowing the browser to “behave” like a former version of itself and stay compatible with websites that had not been updated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>New SharePoint Framework PnP Samples available: using the Skype UCWA Web SDK to subscribe to people’s status</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tldr"&gt;TL;DR;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added two new SharePoint framework WebParts PnP sample to demonstrate how to use the Unified Communications Web API JavaScript SDK from Skype for business. This SDK allows you to do things like subscribe to a person status, start instant messaging conversations, calls…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your custom solutions rely on PnP PowerShell during their build and/or deployment processes, you will need PnP PowerShell to be installed on the agent.
Unfortunately the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/agents/hosted"&gt;Hosted Agents&lt;/a&gt; do not have PnP PowerShell installed by default.

They used to nominate new MVP’s every 3 months and renew people every year on anniversary date.
One of the changes the brought to the program is around the renew and nomination cycles. New MVP’s are awarded every month and existing ones are renewed all together every year in July.
I used to be an “April MVP” and I was used to blogging about my renewal in April.
I’m pleased to announce I’ve been renewed MVP for year 2017-2018 on the Office Servers and Services category.

&lt;p&gt;If you create a new site collection and try to edit page layouts, master pages or even image renditions, there’s a high chance you’ll get an access denied error message. That even if you’re site collection administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating further and checking your permissions on the master page gallery library, you will notice that every and each user has a “deny” permission for “Add and Customize Pages”.

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Microsoft has recently released an update for nugget packages and the method is part of the new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.office.com/blogs/new-sharepoint-csom-version-released-for-Office-365-august-2016-updated"&gt;https://dev.office.com/blogs/new-sharepoint-csom-version-released-for-Office-365-august-2016-updated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an important method because it allows you to update a list item without changing modification date, author, publishing and versioning information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we’re numerous SharePoint developers migrating a lot of full trust solutions to SharePoint Add-ins, some of which were using this method and in some cases we have only an app-only context. Usage of this method instead of the regular update method will avoid having documents last updated by “SharePoint App”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Oslo 2016</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-09-15-14-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-09-15-14-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year I have the privilege to speak at SPS Oslo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s  say that for one reason you want to increment automatically the version number of your SharePoint features when building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a quick look at the “.feature” file you’ll notice that the version attribute looks like a serialized object (instead of simply being the version number), this is way more complicated than simply parsing a XML file.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa 2015</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2015-11-10-14-00-00/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2015-11-10-14-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the SPS Ottawa.

&lt;p&gt;When SharePoint will retract the wsp, it will retract all dll’s that were included within it. Including the common dependency the other product still needs.

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start by some reminders around the theory and describe what are the advantages and disadvantages of different types of each. Then we’ll see what’s currently supported by SharePoint and what are the available tools.

(Expect to have several articles about this as and when I meet and solve errors)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing SharePoint development &lt;strong&gt;we have to sign assemblies with a certificate&lt;/strong&gt;. When the project is initialized there are two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate is protected by a password: (pfx extension) that was with first versions of SharePoint tooling, or if you have created the structure of (visual studio) solution yourself with several assemblies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate is not protected: (snk extension) default option of the tooling for a few years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my case the certificate was protected by a password&lt;/strong&gt; which causes the following problem: that you have to type this password when you want to build the source on a new machine for the first time. This is really not convenient when doing automated build (no human to type a password when building). &lt;strong&gt;This gives us this error message.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at the SharePoint Saturday New Hampshire 2014 !</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-the-sharepoint-sat-2014-10-01-23-34-03/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 23:34:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-the-sharepoint-sat-2014-10-01-23-34-03/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m proud to announce I’ll be speaking at the SharePoint Saturday New Hampshire 2014.

&lt;p&gt;Auto-hosted apps are &lt;strong&gt;only available for SharePoint online&lt;/strong&gt; (office 365), it bundles and provisions at each installation an &lt;strong&gt;azure web site&lt;/strong&gt;(and eventually a sql azure database).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made &lt;strong&gt;hosting&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tenancy management&lt;/strong&gt; (isolating customers’ data) and &lt;strong&gt;authentication&lt;/strong&gt;way easier because most of the configuration part was automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the SharePoint Conference 2014 Microsoft announced a significant change in the limitations of SharePoint Online Storage: 1 TB Max per site collection (including the &amp;ldquo;mysite&amp;rdquo; or onedrive for business) and unlimited storage (understanding billed per GB) by tenant.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Anonymous access for SharePoint autohosted apps</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/anonymous-access-for-sharepoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2014 17:03:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/anonymous-access-for-sharepoin/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;These days I’ve been working on an auto hosted app for SharePoint (office 365 actually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to grant an anonymous access to one of the pages without requiring clients to give anonymous access to their SharePoint site. But I still needed to read a few properties from the App Web web site (the SPWeb provisioned by SharePoint when installing an app)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to play around a lot but I finally found the solution:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Operating system compatibility of SharePoint 2010/2013 has evolved</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/operating-system-compatibility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 02:40:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/operating-system-compatibility/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/operating-system-compatibility/clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_50C91417.jpg" alt="clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_50C91417.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service pack 2 for SharePoint 2010 and Service pack 1 for SharePoint 2013 recently came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-support-of-2012r2-at-last-"&gt;A support of 2012R2 at last !&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both service packs bring support for Windows Server 2012R2&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a recurrent problematic for IT services. How to reduce the number of different versions of an operating system in order to make maintenance cheaper and easier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: &lt;strong&gt;“in place” upgrade of operating system for SharePoint 2013 is not supported by Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt;. You need to reinstall the farm and migrate the content. See section “overview of improvements” in this article &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2817429"&gt;https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2817429&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Repackaging of SharePoint 2010 language packs</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/repackaging-of-sharepoint-2010/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2014 19:57:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/repackaging-of-sharepoint-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010 service pack 2 came out a few months ago from now.

&lt;p&gt;One of these new things is the repackaging of language packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed you may have missed it but it is not required anymore to do a progressive installation in order to support MUI in SharePoint 2010 when setting up a new farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This update integrates SP1’s benefits. It also allows you to develop app for PowerPoint and Access, enhances/add creation/configuration wizards for projects elements and includes more data sources types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the detailed description of the update here &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn610877.aspx"&gt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn610877.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to publish this article months ago, back to the time I found this solution. But I did not mostly because of a lack of free time. Sebastien LEVERT, a top SharePoint developer and a member of Montreal’s SharePoint community, recently published a post about the same subject. Read it (sorry it’s in French), I’ll write my post so it is complementary. &lt;a href="https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/"&gt;https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reminders"&gt;Reminders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly summarize, when you develop SharePoint solutions and you want to support multiple languages (localize it) you need to use .net resources. These resx files are a mechanism coming from asp.net and work as a dictionary (key/value). You have to create one file by supported language. Instead of writing texts in the code (which is a bad practice anyway), you now reference these by defined keys.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Help me to speak at SP24 the first SharePoint (web) conference all around the world!</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/help-me-to-speak-at-sp24-the-f/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2014 22:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/help-me-to-speak-at-sp24-the-f/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/help-me-to-speak-at-sp24-the-f/clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_067CC5C3.png" alt="clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_067CC5C3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some great SharePoint MVP’s are organizing an amazing event on April the 16th/17th : the SP24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing speakers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing conferences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All around the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 tracks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48 sessions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thousands attendees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 hours straight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You even get to choose the sessions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache cluster is in facts made of appfabric hosts (caching services). One of the advantages is that hosts not members of the cluster but clients of it keep a local copy of objects. And this copy is automatically maintained up to date. The result is you do not need to implement a lazy loading pattern to avoid back and forth on the network.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Boost your SharePoint solutions with distributed cache!- Part 1–Introduction</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2013 02:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="prelude"&gt;Prelude&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m fond of SharePoint, I like MVC, why not mixing them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed. The potential cost overhead will be billed directly to the tenant owner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaker at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa!</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-sharepoint-saturday/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2013 03:20:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-sharepoint-saturday/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kyubung13.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ottawacanada336122803554032601.jpeg" alt="parliament hill in winter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody, I’m thrilled to announce that I’ll be speaking at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa. On Nov the 23rd!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My session: translating SharePoint 2013 from beginning to ending. We’ll cover all multilingualism provided by SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With lot of examples and demonstrations we’ll see what are the tools provided to IT pro’s, power users and developers. The goal of this session is to give you some insight about how to get your SharePoint environment in multiple languages seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>(English) The name 'InitializeControl' does not exist in the current context Controles utilisateur, SharePoint 2013 and Ressources</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/the-name-initializecon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2013 21:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/the-name-initializecon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article is written for SharePoint developers who already developed multilingual webparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good practice to localize an application when you develop for SharePoint, which will make the adding of a new language easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we developed for SharePoint 2010 we used to put resources files in hive/config/resources (and then run a stsadm –o copyappbincontent or automate it via a timerjob when activating features)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or we used to create an empty SharePoint solution element in which we added our files and indicated that the deployment target was the appglobalresources folder (see &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/296003/deploy-a-resource-file-to-app-globalresource-folder-on-activation"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/296003/deploy-a-resource-file-to-app-globalresource-folder-on-activation&lt;/a&gt; for more details)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
