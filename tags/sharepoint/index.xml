It is a good practice to localize an application when you develop for SharePoint, which will make the adding of a new language easier.
When we developed for SharePoint 2010 we used to put resources files in hive/config/resources (and then run a stsadm –o copyappbincontent or automate it via a timerjob when activating features)
