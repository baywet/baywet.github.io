&lt;p>&lt;strong>I have the pleasure to announce I’ve been renewed as a Microsoft MVP&lt;/strong>, for the fifth year in a row (time flies, I’m getting old). A slight change this time, &lt;strong>my award is Office development&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the years I’ve been a SharePoint MVP, an Office Servers and Services MVP and now an Office development MVP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally Microsoft had it’s MVPs organized by products, which made a lot of sense in a on premises world which required a deep knowledge in something very specific. Also, it allowed MVP’s to be connected directly with the teams at Microsoft on their product. However, &lt;strong>over the last decade the industry transitioned to a cloud first model and somebody who was working with SharePoint&lt;/strong> (or Exchange, Skype…) &lt;strong>is most likely to be working with Office 365 at large&lt;/strong> (and some Azure as well). A couple of years ago (3?) Microsoft decided to reorganize the MVP program to have award categories (Azure, Office servers and services, Visual Studio and Team Services…) which regroup contribution areas (e.g. OSS: SharePoint, Exchange, Office 365, …)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday New York City 2018</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-06-27-08-00-00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-06-27-08-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2018-06-27-08-00-00/8.jpg" alt="8.jpg">&lt;/p>

They used to nominate new MVP’s every 3 months and renew people every year on anniversary date.
One of the changes the brought to the program is around the renew and nomination cycles. New MVP’s are awarded every month and existing ones are renewed all together every year in July.
I used to be an “April MVP” and I was used to blogging about my renewal in April.
I’m pleased to announce I’ve been renewed MVP for year 2017-2018 on the Office Servers and Services category.

&lt;p>Indeed, Microsoft has recently released an update for nugget packages and the method is part of the new stuff.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s an important method because it allows you to update a list item without changing modification date, author, publishing and versioning information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we’re numerous SharePoint developers migrating a lot of full trust solutions to SharePoint Add-ins, some of which were using this method and in some cases we have only an app-only context. Usage of this method instead of the regular update method will avoid having documents last updated by “SharePoint App”.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Oslo 2016</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-09-15-14-00-00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2016-09-15-14-00-00/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year I have the privilege to speak at SPS Oslo&lt;/p>

(Expect to have several articles about this as and when I meet and solve errors)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When doing SharePoint development &lt;strong>we have to sign assemblies with a certificate&lt;/strong>. When the project is initialized there are two options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Certificate is protected by a password: (pfx extension) that was with first versions of SharePoint tooling, or if you have created the structure of (visual studio) solution yourself with several assemblies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Certificate is not protected: (snk extension) default option of the tooling for a few years&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In my case the certificate was protected by a password&lt;/strong> which causes the following problem: that you have to type this password when you want to build the source on a new machine for the first time. This is really not convenient when doing automated build (no human to type a password when building). &lt;strong>This gives us this error message.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at the SharePoint Saturday New Hampshire 2014 !</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-the-sharepoint-sat-2014-10-01-23-34-03/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 23:34:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-the-sharepoint-sat-2014-10-01-23-34-03/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m proud to announce I’ll be speaking at the SharePoint Saturday New Hampshire 2014.

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wanted to publish this article months ago, back to the time I found this solution. But I did not mostly because of a lack of free time. Sebastien LEVERT, a top SharePoint developer and a member of Montreal’s SharePoint community, recently published a post about the same subject. Read it (sorry it’s in French), I’ll write my post so it is complementary. &lt;a href="https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/">https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reminders">Reminders&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To quickly summarize, when you develop SharePoint solutions and you want to support multiple languages (localize it) you need to use .net resources. These resx files are a mechanism coming from asp.net and work as a dictionary (key/value). You have to create one file by supported language. Instead of writing texts in the code (which is a bad practice anyway), you now reference these by defined keys.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Help me to speak at SP24 the first SharePoint (web) conference all around the world!</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/help-me-to-speak-at-sp24-the-f/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2014 22:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/help-me-to-speak-at-sp24-the-f/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://baywet.github.io/help-me-to-speak-at-sp24-the-f/clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_067CC5C3.png" alt="clip_5F00_image002_5F00_thumb_5F00_067CC5C3.png">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This cache cluster is in facts made of appfabric hosts (caching services). One of the advantages is that hosts not members of the cluster but clients of it keep a local copy of objects. And this copy is automatically maintained up to date. The result is you do not need to implement a lazy loading pattern to avoid back and forth on the network.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boost your SharePoint solutions with distributed cache!- Part 1–Introduction</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2013 02:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="prelude">Prelude&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I started to write this set of articles as one at the beginning, but I quickly realized that I had a lot of things to explain. Moreover, I’m a real chatterbox which does not help in that case. I finally decided to write a trilogy. I will publish one article every two days beginning today. The code sample will be delivered with last article so I ensure that you read everything ;-). Have a nice reading and do not hesitate to comment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SharePoint Auto hosted app and ASP.NET MVC</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-auto-hosted-app-and/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 04:16:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-auto-hosted-app-and/</guid><description>&lt;p>Code apps they said, it will be easier they said…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio 2013 comes with a new project model : SharePoint autohosted app ASP.NET MVC (Cool!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m fond of SharePoint, I like MVC, why not mixing them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed. The potential cost overhead will be billed directly to the tenant owner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaker at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa!</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-sharepoint-saturday/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2013 03:20:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-sharepoint-saturday/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://kyubung13.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ottawacanada336122803554032601.jpeg" alt="parliament hill in winter">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is a good practice to localize an application when you develop for SharePoint, which will make the adding of a new language easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we developed for SharePoint 2010 we used to put resources files in hive/config/resources (and then run a stsadm –o copyappbincontent or automate it via a timerjob when activating features)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or we used to create an empty SharePoint solution element in which we added our files and indicated that the deployment target was the appglobalresources folder (see &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/296003/deploy-a-resource-file-to-app-globalresource-folder-on-activation">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/296003/deploy-a-resource-file-to-app-globalresource-folder-on-activation&lt;/a> for more details)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
