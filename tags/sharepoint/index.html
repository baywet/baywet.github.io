I will be speaking about “Migrate your custom components to the SharePoint Framework”.

<span>2 min.</span></p><p>The history being this situation…. Internet Explorer has been a corporate browser for two decades now. And many of us remember the dark ages of web development when we needed to have “IE compatible code” and “web compatible code”.
As many companies invested deeply in the browser building portals that worked with specific versions, Microsoft provided a decade ago a compatibility mode, allowing the browser to “behave” like a former version of itself and stay compatible with websites that had not been updated.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/new-sharepoint-framework-pnp-s/>New SharePoint Framework PnP Samples available: using the Skype UCWA Web SDK to subscribe to people’s status</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jan 8, 2018</span>

<span>2 min.</span></p><p>Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) provides great Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) functionalities you can leverage to implement DevOps pipelines and automation with your custom developments.
If your custom solutions rely on PnP PowerShell during their build and/or deployment processes, you will need PnP PowerShell to be installed on the agent. Unfortunately the Hosted Agents do not have PnP PowerShell installed by default. Note: that documentation only applies to the Hosted and Hosted 2017 agents, the Linux Hosted Agent is not supported at the moment</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sharepoint-saturda-2017-07-13-08-00-00/>Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Brussels 2017</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jul 13, 2017</span>

<span>1 min.</span></p><p>You may not know it but Microsoft has changed the organization of the MVP program during these last few years. They used to nominate new MVP’s every 3 months and renew people every year on anniversary date. One of the changes the brought to the program is around the renew and nomination cycles. New MVP’s are awarded every month and existing ones are renewed all together every year in July.

( @andrewconnell founded voitanos recently)
The idea is to get the thoughts from the community and people who have been around the SharePoint development for a few years. If you don&rsquo;t know that series I&rsquo;d encourage you to check it out and I also hope that the product team behind the framework is listening the that super valuable feedback.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/update-to-sppagecontextinfo-ty/>Update to _spPageContextInfo type definitions - new properties available</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jun 16, 2017</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>If you&rsquo;re building modern SharePoint components (Framework or not), there&rsquo;s a high chance you&rsquo;re using TypeScript.
In that case you&rsquo;re probably using @types/SharePoint to provide auto-completion as well as some level of understanding for the compiler of what&rsquo;s going on.
There&rsquo;s one object in particular that SharePoint hydrates for us to give some understanding of where the user is and what he/she is doing: _spPageContextInfo.
A lot of properties were missing in those type definitions, old stuff like the web Id but also new things coming from SharePoint Online like canUserCreateMicrosoftForm.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/customizing-page-layouts-maste/>Customizing page layouts, master pages and image renditions in SharePoint Online</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>May 23, 2017</span>
<span>2 min.</span></p><p>Microsoft recently made changes around look and feel customizations for SharePoint Online.
If you create a new site collection and try to edit page layouts, master pages or even image renditions, there’s a high chance you’ll get an access denied error message. That even if you’re site collection administrator.
Investigating further and checking your permissions on the master page gallery library, you will notice that every and each user has a “deny” permission for “Add and Customize Pages”.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-techorama-belgium/>Speaking at Techorama Belgium 2017</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Apr 26, 2017</span>

I quickly suspected a configuration issue for the load balancer dispatching calls between the front-end servers. However, I only had access to the SharePoint farm and I had to provide data so the network team so they could start investigating.

It’s an important method because it allows you to update a list item without changing modification date, author, publishing and versioning information.

During the SharePoint Conference 2014 Microsoft announced a significant change in the limitations of SharePoint Online Storage: 1 TB Max per site collection (including the &ldquo;mysite&rdquo; or onedrive for business) and unlimited storage (understanding billed per GB) by tenant.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/anonymous-access-for-sharepoin/>Anonymous access for SharePoint autohosted apps</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 12, 2014</span>
<span>1 min.</span></p><p>These days I’ve been working on an auto hosted app for SharePoint (office 365 actually).
I had to grant an anonymous access to one of the pages without requiring clients to give anonymous access to their SharePoint site. But I still needed to read a few properties from the App Web web site (the SPWeb provisioned by SharePoint when installing an app)
I had to play around a lot but I finally found the solution:</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/operating-system-compatibility/>Operating system compatibility of SharePoint 2010/2013 has evolved</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 11, 2014</span>

One of these new things is the repackaging of language packs.
Indeed you may have missed it but it is not required anymore to do a progressive installation in order to support MUI in SharePoint 2010 when setting up a new farm.
Before, when one wanted to install language packs (let’s take for example French English and Spanish), one had to:</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/march-update-of-visual-studio/>March Update of Visual Studio tools for Office</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Mar 6, 2014</span>

This update integrates SP1’s benefits. It also allows you to develop app for PowerPoint and Access, enhances/add creation/configuration wizards for projects elements and includes more data sources types.
You can find the detailed description of the update here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn610877.aspx
It’s very simple to update your installation, open Visual Studio, tools, Extensions and updates.
Have fun coding!</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/managing-resources-how-to-make/>Managing Resources, how to make your SharePoint solutions “globally deployed”</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Jan 23, 2014</span>

One of the advantages is that hosts not members of the cluster but clients of it keep a local copy of objects. And this copy is automatically maintained up to date. The result is you do not need to implement a lazy loading pattern to avoid back and forth on the network.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/>Boost your SharePoint solutions with distributed cache!- Part 1–Introduction</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Dec 13, 2013</span>

I’m fond of SharePoint, I like MVC, why not mixing them?
Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed. The potential cost overhead will be billed directly to the tenant owner.</p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-content><p class=title><a href=https://baywet.github.io/speaker-at-sharepoint-saturday/>Speaker at SharePoint Saturday Ottawa!</a></p><p class="subtitle is-flex" style=justify-content:space-between><span>Oct 25, 2013</span>

It is a good practice to localize an application when you develop for SharePoint, which will make the adding of a new language easier.
When we developed for SharePoint 2010 we used to put resources files in hive/config/resources (and then run a stsadm –o copyappbincontent or automate it via a timerjob when activating features)
Or we used to create an empty SharePoint solution element in which we added our files and indicated that the deployment target was the appglobalresources folder (see https://stackoverflow.</p></div></article></ul></div></section><footer class=footer><div class=container><nav class=level></nav><nav class=level><div class="level-left has-text-centered"><div class=level-item><form class="control has-icons has-icons-right" method=get action=https://duckduckgo.com><input class=input type=text name=q maxlength=255 placeholder=Search>
