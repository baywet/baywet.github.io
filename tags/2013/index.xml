&lt;p>Service pack 2 for SharePoint 2010 and Service pack 1 for SharePoint 2013 recently came out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-support-of-2012r2-at-last-">A support of 2012R2 at last !&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Both service packs bring support for Windows Server 2012R2&lt;/strong>. This is a recurrent problematic for IT services. How to reduce the number of different versions of an operating system in order to make maintenance cheaper and easier?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warning: &lt;strong>“in place” upgrade of operating system for SharePoint 2013 is not supported by Microsoft&lt;/strong>. You need to reinstall the farm and migrate the content.

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wanted to publish this article months ago, back to the time I found this solution. But I did not mostly because of a lack of free time. Sebastien LEVERT, a top SharePoint developer and a member of Montreal’s SharePoint community, recently published a post about the same subject. Read it (sorry it’s in French), I’ll write my post so it is complementary. &lt;a href="https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/">https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reminders">Reminders&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To quickly summarize, when you develop SharePoint solutions and you want to support multiple languages (localize it) you need to use .net resources. These resx files are a mechanism coming from asp.net and work as a dictionary (key/value). You have to create one file by supported language. Instead of writing texts in the code (which is a bad practice anyway), you now reference these by defined keys.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boost your SharePoint solutions with distributed cache!–Part 2–Explanations tips and warnings</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-15-12-06-00/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 12:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-15-12-06-00/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="explanations-tips-tricks-and-warnings">Explanations, tips, tricks and warnings&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>This cache cluster is in facts made of appfabric hosts (caching services). One of the advantages is that hosts not members of the cluster but clients of it keep a local copy of objects. And this copy is automatically maintained up to date. The result is you do not need to implement a lazy loading pattern to avoid back and forth on the network.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boost your SharePoint solutions with distributed cache!- Part 1–Introduction</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2013 02:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="prelude">Prelude&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I started to write this set of articles as one at the beginning, but I quickly realized that I had a lot of things to explain. Moreover, I’m a real chatterbox which does not help in that case. I finally decided to write a trilogy. I will publish one article every two days beginning today. The code sample will be delivered with last article so I ensure that you read everything ;-). Have a nice reading and do not hesitate to comment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SharePoint Auto hosted app and ASP.NET MVC</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-auto-hosted-app-and/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 04:16:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/sharepoint-auto-hosted-app-and/</guid><description>&lt;p>Code apps they said, it will be easier they said…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio 2013 comes with a new project model : SharePoint autohosted app ASP.NET MVC (Cool!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m fond of SharePoint, I like MVC, why not mixing them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed. The potential cost overhead will be billed directly to the tenant owner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>(English) The name 'InitializeControl' does not exist in the current context Controles utilisateur, SharePoint 2013 and Ressources</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/the-name-initializecon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2013 21:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/the-name-initializecon/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is written for SharePoint developers who already developed multilingual webparts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a good practice to localize an application when you develop for SharePoint, which will make the adding of a new language easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we developed for SharePoint 2010 we used to put resources files in hive/config/resources (and then run a stsadm –o copyappbincontent or automate it via a timerjob when activating features)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or we used to create an empty SharePoint solution element in which we added our files and indicated that the deployment target was the appglobalresources folder (see &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/296003/deploy-a-resource-file-to-app-globalresource-folder-on-activation">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/296003/deploy-a-resource-file-to-app-globalresource-folder-on-activation&lt;/a> for more details)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
