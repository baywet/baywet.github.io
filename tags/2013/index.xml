A support of 2012R2 at last ! Both service packs bring support for Windows Server 2012R2. This is a recurrent problematic for IT services. How to reduce the number of different versions of an operating system in order to make maintenance cheaper and easier?

But I did not mostly because of a lack of free time. Sebastien LEVERT, a top SharePoint developer and a member of Montreal’s SharePoint community, recently published a post about the same subject. Read it (sorry it’s in French), I’ll write my post so it is complementary. https://www.pimpmysharepoint.com/2014/01/09/deployer-des-fichiers-de-ressources-simplement/

One of the advantages is that hosts not members of the cluster but clients of it keep a local copy of objects. And this copy is automatically maintained up to date. The result is you do not need to implement a lazy loading pattern to avoid back and forth on the network.</description></item><item><title>Boost your SharePoint solutions with distributed cache!- Part 1–Introduction</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2013 02:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/boost-your-sharepoint-solution-2013-12-13-02-35-30/</guid><description>Prelude I started to write this set of articles as one at the beginning, but I quickly realized that I had a lot of things to explain.

Visual Studio 2013 comes with a new project model : SharePoint autohosted app ASP.NET MVC (Cool!)
I’m fond of SharePoint, I like MVC, why not mixing them?
Short reminder, SharePoint autohosted apps are only available for Office 365. Technically Office 365 will create an Azure website on demand when app is deployed. The potential cost overhead will be billed directly to the tenant owner.</description></item><item><title>(English) The name 'InitializeControl' does not exist in the current context Controles utilisateur, SharePoint 2013 and Ressources</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/english-the-name-initializecon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2013 21:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/english-the-name-initializecon/</guid><description>This article is written for SharePoint developers who already developed multilingual webparts.
It is a good practice to localize an application when you develop for SharePoint, which will make the adding of a new language easier.
When we developed for SharePoint 2010 we used to put resources files in hive/config/resources (and then run a stsadm –o copyappbincontent or automate it via a timerjob when activating features)
Or we used to create an empty SharePoint solution element in which we added our files and indicated that the deployment target was the appglobalresources folder (see https://stackoverflow.</description></item></channel></rss>
