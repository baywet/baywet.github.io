This event is dear to my heart as it’s one of the first international events I ever got to speak at, it always attracts a great crowd and brings together internationally regarded speakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll be presenting “Turbocharge your API integration with Microsoft Kiota” where I’ll be introducing through lots of demonstrations how you can generate a client generated for any OpenAPI described API using &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/kiota">Microsoft Kiota&lt;/a> and other tools.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One year as a Software Developer at Microsoft</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/one-year-developer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/one-year-developer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="one-year-as-a-software-developer-at-microsoft">One year as a Software Developer at Microsoft&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Back in September 2020, I published a &lt;a href="https://baywet.github.io/pm-experience-dev-sdk/">blog post about my experience as a Program Manager at Microsoft that was well received&lt;/a>. It made me realize that the community was curious and interested about this role. In this post, I will share my insights as a developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we begin, &lt;strong>keep in mind this is my personal experience&lt;/strong>, which may differ a lot from team to team, product to product and depend on other circumstances (being remote, culture, etc…).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revamping the Microsoft Graph Java SDK: a recipe to revive open-source repositories</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/github-repo-revival/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/github-repo-revival/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back in August 2020 I became the main maintainer of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-java">Microsoft Graph Java SDK&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team had to deprioritize this SDK in favor of other languages due to a lack of staff. About 100+ issues were open, as well as 15 pull requests from the community. Dependencies and tooling had not been updated, the Android story was unclear, no innovation had been done in a long time, the repository felt abandoned and caused a lot of frustrations…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at Microsoft 365 Saturday Ottawa 2020</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sps-ottawa-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sps-ottawa-2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the Microsoft 365 (formerly SPS) Ottawa and I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Introduction To The Microsoft Graph: Getting Started Quickly &amp;amp; Getting The Most Out Of It&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
