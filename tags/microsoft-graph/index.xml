This event is dear to my heart as it’s one of the first international events I ever got to speak at, it always attracts a great crowd and brings together internationally regarded speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be presenting “Turbocharge your API integration with Microsoft Kiota” where I’ll be introducing through lots of demonstrations how you can generate a client generated for any OpenAPI described API using &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/kiota"&gt;Microsoft Kiota&lt;/a&gt; and other tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One year as a Software Developer at Microsoft</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/one-year-developer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/one-year-developer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="one-year-as-a-software-developer-at-microsoft"&gt;One year as a Software Developer at Microsoft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in September 2020, I published a &lt;a href="https://baywet.github.io/pm-experience-dev-sdk/"&gt;blog post about my experience as a Program Manager at Microsoft that was well received&lt;/a&gt;. It made me realize that the community was curious and interested about this role. In this post, I will share my insights as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, &lt;strong&gt;keep in mind this is my personal experience&lt;/strong&gt;, which may differ a lot from team to team, product to product and depend on other circumstances (being remote, culture, etc…).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Revamping the Microsoft Graph Java SDK: a recipe to revive open-source repositories</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/github-repo-revival/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/github-repo-revival/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in August 2020 I became the main maintainer of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-java"&gt;Microsoft Graph Java SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team had to deprioritize this SDK in favor of other languages due to a lack of staff. About 100+ issues were open, as well as 15 pull requests from the community. Dependencies and tooling had not been updated, the Android story was unclear, no innovation had been done in a long time, the repository felt abandoned and caused a lot of frustrations…&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at Microsoft 365 Saturday Ottawa 2020</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sps-ottawa-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/speaking-at-sps-ottawa-2020/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year again I have the opportunity to speak at the Microsoft 365 (formerly SPS) Ottawa and I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction To The Microsoft Graph: Getting Started Quickly &amp;amp; Getting The Most Out Of It&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together we will cover the basics of Microsoft Graph, the Microsoft Identity Platform, the value it provides to developers and how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the ongoing pandemic, the event will be digital only and held on Microsoft Teams. This means you can attend the event for free from anywhere in the world! The organizing team had been putting a lot of efforts into making sure attendees get the most of this digital format.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My personal experience as a Program Manager and switching back to development</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/pm-experience-dev-sdk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/pm-experience-dev-sdk/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="switching-back-to-the-light-side-of-the-force-becoming-a-developer-again"&gt;Switching back to the light side of the force: becoming a developer again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently transitioned from &lt;strong&gt;Program Manager on Microsoft Graph&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Software Developer in the Microsoft Graph SDKs team&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my previous team for welcoming me these last 7 months and allowing me to experiment with the role of Program Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with you some of my experience and learnings as a Program Manager. Before you dive in, &lt;strong&gt;keep in mind this is my personal experience&lt;/strong&gt;, which may differ a lot from team to team, product to product and depend on other circumstances (being remote, cultural, etc&amp;hellip;). &lt;strong&gt;Do not take this article for a single source of truth&lt;/strong&gt;, there are other experiences that have been shared out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Build 2020 Microsoft Graph session recordings available</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/msbuild-msgraph-whatsnew/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/msbuild-msgraph-whatsnew/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it (and yes I know this post is really late), Microsoft Build 2020 produced hundreds of sessions with great content.

&lt;p&gt;During this episode we discussed about two main topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Microsoft Graph open extensions (currently starting a project using those at 2toLead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Calendar capabilities in the Microsoft Graph (and I shared a few tricks that might interested you if you plan on using those APIs)&lt;/li&gt;
