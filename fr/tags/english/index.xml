It’s a great tool in terms of provisioning delays and simplicity of usage. In order to setup my farm I needed ISO files (installation media). The most recommended way to do that according to the documentation is to locally create a vhd file and upload it to azure to then attach it to your machine.
As a fellow developer I thought right away “azure has a great tooling inside Visual Studio, we have a storage explorer, let’s use it”.</description></item><item><title>Service Pack 1 for Office suite 2013 (client and server) is out!</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/fr/service-pack-1-for-office-suit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2014 02:28:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/fr/service-pack-1-for-office-suit/</guid><description>As expected the service pack 1 for office has been released right before the SharePoint Conference (3rd to 6th March, Las Vegas) by product teams.

Sometimes SharePoint farms we are setting up do not have access to the internet. This will be less and less the case because SharePoint has a growing services number needing access to the internet to work properly.
In addition your system admins and/or virtualization admins can exclude installation sources from machines they provide to you.</description></item><item><title>Boost your SharePoint solutions with distributed cache!–Part 3–Let’s Code!</title><link>https://baywet.github.io/fr/boost-your-sharepoint-solution/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2013 12:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baywet.github.io/fr/boost-your-sharepoint-solution/</guid><description>Let’s code! All what you need is located in these namspaces Microsoft.SharePoint.DistributedCaching , Microsoft.SharePoint.DistributedCaching.Utilities, Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching, it is strictly forbidden to reference anything else coming from the appfabric sdk!
Another information, depending on your version of SharePoint and of Visual Studio it is possible that you don’t have these dll’s in SharePoint’s ISAPI (folders VS will look at to know which assemblies are available for your projects). In that case you will need to reference dll’s directly from their GAC location.</description></item></channel></rss>
